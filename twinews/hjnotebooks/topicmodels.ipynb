      "Powermat, the only contender to the dominant format Qi, has joined the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) and now backs its rival . \"Qi has become the dominant wireless charging standard on the market and the recently launched Apple iPhone lineup is evidence of this success, \" Powermat said in a statement. \"[We] will share technology innovation to further unlock wireless charging potential, and will expedite the growth of the wireless charging infrastructure.\" Engadget reports: Powermat was barely hanging on as a standard, but as it mentioned, Apple's favoring of Qi for its upcoming chargers pretty much sealed its fate. The company was forced to upgrade its chargers to support Qi at Starbucks locations, for instance, so that Apple's Qi-supported iPhone X- and 8-owning clients could juice up. Until a few years ago, there were essentially three standards, the Alliance for Wireless Power, the Power Matters Alliance (no joking), and Qi, which was already the dominant player. The first two merged to form the Airfuel alliance in 2015, of which Powermat was the main player.\n",

      "Both the House and Senate have passed their respective tax reform bills, but keep the cork in the champagne. The process has to overcome one more hurdle before it hits the president's desk: The conference committee — the ad hoc, temporary panel created to reconcile differences between the House and Senate bills.\n",
      "If you haven't heard of a conference committee for a while (or ever), it's understandable. Conference committees, once used repeatedly, are now rarely seen around D.C. In the 106th Congress (1999-2000), conference committees convened 38 times. The 113th Congress (2013-2014) appointed just three.\n",
      "In part, this is because the process has become far less meaningful than it used to be. Historically, conference committees have been hotbeds for deal making and hard-nosed negotiations among lots of members, with each chamber fighting for its priorities as well as its prestige. The conference committee for the 1981 omnibus budget reconciliation, for example, involved over 250 senators and congressman who met in 58 subconferences to consider nearly 300 issues.\n",
      "In the modern Congress, conference committees tend to be much smaller. Much like the debate in the respective chambers, the conference process is now tightly controlled by leadership with the final product negotiated by a handful of staff, out of sight, and conferees appointed mostly for show.\n",
      "Despite an effort by leadership to control the outcome, however, the conference process invokes new variables that could lead to a significantly modified bill.\n",
      "This is especially true given the amount of arm twisting and deal making taking place, the presence of which could jeopardize support from key factions of conservatives in the House and Senate.\n",
      "Sen. Jeff Flake Jeffrey (Jeff) Lane FlakeOvernight Energy: Reporters barred from Day 2 of EPA summit | Dems blame Trump for gas price increases | Massachusetts to get new offshore wind farm Jeff Flake: Trump has 'debased' the presidency Senate Democrats look for traction on gas prices MORE (R-Ariz.) cast his favorable vote based on a promise from Senate Republican leadership to provide a legislative solution on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a move seen as amnesty by many conservatives.\n",
      "Similarly, Sen. Susan Collins Susan Margaret CollinsOvernight Health Care — Sponsored by PCMA — VA reform bill heads to Trump's desk Senate panel to consider ban on prescription drug 'gag clauses' Pressure rising on GOP after Trump — DOJ fight's latest turn MORE (R-Maine) wrung free a commitment from Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell says he backs Mueller probe after classified briefing Overnight Finance: Trump signs Dodd-Frank rollback | Snubs key Dems at ceremony | Senate confirms banking regulator | Lawmakers lash out on Trump auto tariffs Senate Dems' campaign chief 'welcomes' midterm support from Clintons MORE (R-Ky.) to support billions in ObamaCare bailouts, another topic sure to trigger the ire of the conservative base. Collins, ever resourceful, also won a commitment to prevent any cuts to Medicare.\n",
      "In a move sure to trouble deficit hawks, both House and Senate leadership have announced that they will waive the pay-as-you-go law, which was passed to encourage Congress to keep the deficit in check.\n",
      "And these are just the deals that we know about. Members across the spectrum may have been bought off for much less, or much more, a fact which will only emerge in tandem with the final vote.\n",
      "Once the bill gets to conference, other controversial issues within the tax bill will likely surface and must be dealt with, including the state and local tax deduction, the repeal of the individual mandate and the mortgage interest deduction, among others. Deals will have to be cut on these issues, and votes will have to be bought with compromise, policy tweaks and promises. Policies which motivated members to vote for the bill in the House or the Senate may be significantly modified — or dropped altogether.\n",
      "There's a reason that former Ways and Means Chair Bill Thomas (R-Calif.) once described the conference process as \"akin to mating a Chihuahua with a Great Dane.\"\n",
      "The conference process is, fundamentally, an exercise in negotiation, palm-greasing, strong-arming, supplication and pay-offs. It's as easy for a bill to successfully emerge, duct-taped together with a truckload of promises and last-minute deals as it is for it to collapse, dead from a thousand cuts.\n",
      "For conservatives, the question now presents itself: will the tax reform they want to support remain intact? Or will the integrity of the initial bill crumble under the weight of promises to pass DACA, to bailout insurance companies and justify trillion dollar deficits?\n",
      "The only thing certain about a conference committee is just how uncertain it truly is, especially with so many polarizing side deals already in place. Congress better buckle up, because this tax reform ride is far from over.\n"

      "Total federal tax revenues were the third highest in U.S. history.\n",
      "While it was collecting the third highest total tax revenues in U.S. history, the federal government ran a deficit $665,712,000,000 because of its high total spending.\n",
      "Republicans have controlled the House of Representatives since 2011, after winning a majority of seats in the 2010 election. They have controlled the Senate since 2015, after winning a majority in the 2014 election. In fiscal years 2016 and 2017, a Congress in which the Republican Party controls both houses was responsible for enacting all federal spending legislation.\n",
      "Total federal spending in fiscal 2017, according to the Treasury, was $3,980,605,000,000. Total federal tax revenue was $3,314,893,000,000.\n",

      "In the years after 2009, real federal spending hit its lowest level ($3,633,572,490,000 in constant 2017 dollars) in fiscal 2014.

      "Specter of Race Shadows Jeff Sessions, Potential Trump Nominee for Cabinet\n",
      "Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, right, arriving at Trump Tower in Manhattan on Wednesday. He is seen as a strong contender for attorney general or secretary of defense in the Trump administration.CreditSam Hodgson for The New York Times\n",
      "WASHINGTON — In 1981, a Justice Department prosecutor from Washington stopped by to see Jeff Sessions, the United States attorney in Mobile, Ala., at the time. The prosecutor, J. Gerald Hebert, said he had heard a shocking story: A federal judge had called a prominent white lawyer \"a disgrace to his race\" for representing black clients.\n",
      "\"Well, \" Mr. Sessions replied, according to Mr. Hebert, \"maybe he is.\"\n",
      "In testimony before Congress in 1986, Mr. Hebert and others painted an unflattering portrait of Mr. Sessions, who would go on to become a senator from Alabama and now, according to numerous sources close to President-elect Donald J. Trump's transition team, is a potential nominee for attorney general or secretary of defense. Mr. Hebert testified that Mr. Sessions had referred to the American Civil Liberties Union and the N.A.A.C.P. as \"un-American\" for \"trying to force civil rights down the throats of people.\"\n",
      "One African-American prosecutor testified that Mr. Sessions had called him \"boy\" and joked that he thought that the Ku Klux Klan \"was O.K. until I found out they smoked pot.\"\n",
      "Mr. Sessions denied calling the lawyer \"boy\" but acknowledged or did not dispute the substance of the other remarks. The bitter testimony sank his nomination by President Ronald Reagan to be a federal district court judge and foreshadowed the questions that Mr. Sessions could face at another set of Senate confirmation hearings if Mr. Trump nominates him for a cabinet position.\n",
      "Mr. Sessions testified in 1986 that he could not remember saying that a white lawyer might be a disgrace to his race for representing black clients. But he did not contest the allegation, made by a colleague.\n",
      "After nearly 20 years in the Senate, Mr. Sessions, 69, now has more allies and would face a clearer road to confirmation than he did as a young judicial nominee. And as the first senator to endorse Mr. Trump's presidential campaign, he has a special status as an early supporter who became an important surrogate and close adviser.\n",
      "But for Mr. Trump a Sessions nomination to a critical position at the Justice or Defense Department still presents risks. Mr. Trump faced criticism over his derogatory remarks about Mexicans and his support from racist groups throughout his campaign, and for his appointment of a nationalist media executive to a top White House position since his election. A Sessions nomination raises the possibility that a Trump administration will open with racially charged hearings.\n",
      "A spokesman for Mr. Sessions did not respond to a request for comment. But on Tuesday, Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who opposed Mr. Trump's candidacy, enthusiastically endorsed Mr. Sessions for a major job in the Trump administration.\n",
      "\"I think Jeff Sessions has earned the right to serve Donald Trump in the highest levels, \" he told reporters .\n",
      "As attorney general, Mr. Sessions would be responsible for upholding civil rights laws. As secretary of defense, he would oversee one of the most ethnically diverse institutions in the country; 25 percent of the military is African-American, Asian or Hispanic.\n",
      "As one of the most conservative members of the Senate, Mr. Sessions has been a reliable voice for strict immigration enforcement, reduced spending and tough-on-crime measures. He is generally well liked among colleagues in both parties, and took a political risk endorsing Mr. Trump shortly after the South Carolina primary. His views on immigration and trade are aligned with the message that Mr. Trump conveyed during the race. Mr. Sessions has frequently traveled with Mr. Trump and was said at one point to be under consideration as the vice-presidential nominee.\n",
      "Mr. Sessions has long considered it a personal triumph that he was elected to the Senate and became a member of the Judiciary Committee after that same panel rejected his nomination to the bench. Two Republicans joined Democrats in opposing his nomination. One of those Republicans, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, later said his vote had been a mistake — a fact that Mr. Sessions likes to point out.\n",
      "But Mr. Sessions' 1986 hearings were unusually rancorous, both for the era and for the position he was seeking. The sessions stretched for hours as Justice Department officials were called to testify about their colleague's views on race. Mr. Sessions said his comment about the Klan was meant as a joke and said it was so preposterous — especially since he was in the middle of prosecuting a case involving the group — that he thought nobody could take it seriously.\n",
      "He was less clear about his remarks about civil rights groups. Asked whether he ever said the N.A.A.C.P. hates white people or was \"a commie group and a pinko organization, \" Mr. Sessions said he could not recall specifically saying that. \"I am loose with my tongue on occasion, and I may have said something similar to that or could be interpreted to that, \" he testified.\n",
      "He went on to praise the N.A.A.C.P. for its work for racial equality in the South. He said he never called the group or the A.C.L.U. un-American, but added: \"I said that they take positions that are considered un-American. They hurt themselves; they lose credibility. And many people do think that some of those positions they take are against the national interests of the United States.\" He said he was referring to liberal immigration policies and support for the socialist Sandinista government in Nicaragua.\n",
      "An African-American prosecutor, Thomas H. Figures, testified in 1986 that Jeff Sessions had called him \"boy\" when they worked together in Alabama. Mr. Sessions adamantly denied it.\n",
      "At the Justice Department today, lawyers regard N.A.A.C.P. officials as partners in the fight for equal rights. \"Laws alone do not guarantee justice, eradicate hate or advance freedom, \" Vanita Gupta, the Obama administration's top civil rights prosecutor, told the group in July. \"People do. People like you do. Organizations like the N.A.A.C.P. do.\"\n",
      "The N.A.A.C.P. also played a key role in fighting to integrate the military. The percentage of African-Americans in the military — now 17 percent — has grown steadily since President Harry S. Truman signed an order in 1948 that ended segregation in the armed forces.\n",
      "Mr. Sessions also did not dispute Mr. Hebert's recollection of their conversation about the white lawyer. He said he remembered the conversation, but not precisely what he said. \"I guess I will not disagree with him, \" Mr. Sessions testified, \"and I do not know why — I cannot imagine why I would make that comment.\"\n",
      "An African-American prosecutor, Thomas H. Figures, testified that Mr. Sessions referred to him as \"boy.\" Once, after an argument with a secretary, \"Mr. Sessions admonished me to 'be careful what you say to white folks,'\" Mr. Figures testified. Mr. Sessions denied saying that and was adamant that he had never called Mr. Figures \"boy.\"\n",
      "Mr. Sessions had his supporters, including an Alabama judge, Ferrill D. McRae. \"I have watched this young man since he started practicing law in Mobile, \" Judge McRae wrote. \"He is honest, hard-working, fair and compassionate for all his fellow man.\"\n",
      "In a phone interview on Wednesday, Mr. Hebert said it was a \"frightening thought\" that Mr. Sessions might lead the Justice Department. As for the Pentagon, he said, \"His racial insensitivity might not be as manifest in such a position, but I wouldn't feel good about it if I were a black soldier.\"\n",

      "Much later that night, without any explanation to colleagues, Kalodimos cleaned out her belongings at her desk and a storage area.\n",
      "The next day, news director Eck held a meeting to tell staffers Kalodimos still worked at the station and that Eck had no idea why Kalodimos had cleaned out her work areas.\n",

      "The Senate Banking Committee voted 10 — 13 yesterday to reject former New Jersey Rep. Scott Garrett to head the Export-Import Bank, an institution that has become synonymous with corporate welfare. Two Republicans on the committee — Sens. Mike Rounds (R — S.D.) and Tim Scott (R — S.C.) — broke ranks to vote against Garrett, who had called for the bank's elimination while he was in Congress and who had promised to reform the institution if tapped to lead it.\n",
      "Scott cited Garrett's \"long history opposing the Ex-Im Bank\" in explaining his vote. Scott's state contains a plant for the aviation giant Boeing, whose customers get some 40 percent of the Export-Import Bank's financing. The institution is sometimes called \"Boeing's bank.\"\n",
      "In opposing Garrett's nomination, Scott and Rounds made common cause with their Democratic colleagues.\n",
      "Sen. Maria Cantwell (D — Wash.) — whose home state also contains major Boeing operations — said in a statement that she \"applauds\" the banking committee's rejection of Garret. \"If we want to create jobs across America, we need a fully functioning Export-Import Bank approving these deals from manufacturers that are ready to close sales and hire workers.\" Sen. Sherrod Brown (D — Ohio), the ranking Democrat on the banking committee, called Garret's nomination \"inappropriate, \" adding that \"the National Association of Manufacturers, Chamber of Commerce, Aerospace Industries Association and the Ohio Manufacturing Association all oppose his nomination.\"\n",
      "The Bank works by giving low-interest loans — backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. taxpayer — to foreign customers of American exporters. It also issues guarantees to private banks making loans to foreign purchasers of American products, promising to cover these banks' losses should these foreign debtors fail to make good on their obligations.\n",
      "Because of these direct taxpayer subsidies for corporate sales, critics have long derided the bank as one of the worst examples of crony capitalism. The Competitive Enterprise Institute's Daniel Press calls it \"one of the capital's greatest boondoggles.\" Veronique de Rugy of the Mercatus Center — a Reason columnist — has frequently suggested that the bank should be scrapped.\n",
      "On this point, Garrett was once in agreement. While in Congress, he voted repeatedly to eliminate the Export-Import Bank. He has described it bluntly as an institution that \"embodies the corruption of the free market system.\" If Garret had been approved — and if he kept that reformist spirit — he could have used his perch to expose bad deals and improper conduct.\n",
      "Since 2015, operations of the Export-Import bank have been largely stalled, as empty board seats have left it without the quorum it needs to approve larger deals. The silver lining to Garrett's rejection is that the Bank will continue to be hobbled in conducting many of its ordinary operations.\n",
      "Regardless, the Senate's refusal to confirm him demonstrates how entrenched, and indeed how bipartisan, corporatist interests in federal government are.\n",
      "For all his faults, President Donald Trump has appointed a number of reformist, free-market-minded officials to staff his administration, including Neomi Rao at the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs and Scott Gottlieb at the Food and Drug Administration. But Garret proved a bridge too far. Big business, progressive Democrats, and conservative Republicans closed ranks to prevent him from getting his hands on Boeing's bank.\n",

      "Both English and Mulvaney are in the building, sending out dueling emails about who is in charge. On Sunday evening, English took Trump and Mulvaney to court in a final effort to assert her authority.\n",
      "Predictably, Democrats are throwing tantrums over Trump's alleged lawlessness — a point over which they are legally wrong Irrefutably so . The rule of law here is as clear as it can be. The core of executive power is, as James Madison said, that of \"appointing, overseeing and controlling those who execute the laws.\"\n",
      "The left's repeated opposition to the obvious is, as Ben Domenech noted recently, \"the most recent and most clarifying example of the #Resistance folks being completely and utterly corrupted by their opposition to this president.\"\n",
      "However, the furor over the status of CFPB as an \"independent agency\" — an entity of the government, but somehow outside the scope of the president's authority — highlights the troubling degree to which independent agencies have accumulated power outside of the purview of the executive (and to that end, the Constitution).\n",
      "Independent agencies, unlike their other executive branch counterparts such as the Department of Agriculture, Department of Energy, and so on, are so named because they were created with a modicum of self-governing authority that, allegedly, resists the pull of politics.\n",
      "However, their independence is not all encompassing. The Federal Reserve, probably the most well-known of the independent agencies, still has to rely on Congress for its funding — and thus, its oversight. The Securities and Exchange Commission, another independent agency, was told by the Supreme Court in 2010 that the president \"may hold the commission accountable for everything ... it does.\"\n",
      "The CFPB, however, was created in 2010 as something else entirely — a freak hybrid of authorities that attempted to put the agency entirely outside the scope of congressional and executive oversight. That is, an agency with a tremendous amount of power to impact the daily lives of Americans, with accountability to no one.\n",
      "In practice, the CFPB has been a partisan disaster, becoming a politicized behemoth that regularly overreaches into areas outside of its mandate.\n",
      "As a practical matter, its structure is unlikely to ultimately survive the basic threshold test of constitutionality (indeed, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals struck it down as unconstitutional in 2016, though the matter is still unresolved), but its existence points to a troubling trend indicating where independent agencies may be heading.\n",
      "As D.C. Circuit Judge Brett Kavanaugh observed, CFPB-type agencies constitute \"a headless fourth branch of U.S. government, \" which, \"in the absence of presidential supervision and direction, \" can \"pose a significant threat to individual liberty and to the constitutional separation of powers and checks and balances.\"\n",
      "This is especially true in the power these agencies hold to issue regulations over American companies and individuals. While independent agencies are subject to limited congressional scrutiny and oversight, their regulatory authority is nearly unchecked.\n",
      "Unlike their executive branch counterparts, independent agencies go through none of the rigors of cost benefit analysis or the good governance tests required by the Office of Management and Budget.\n",
      "This would be less of problem if the regulations put out by these independents weren't so significant — and growing.\n",
      "A rough measure of this trend can be found in the Office of Management and Budget's record of independent agency's \"major\" rules — regulations with an economic impact estimated to be $100 million or more.\n",
      "According to OMB, independent agencies have increased their output of major rules from just 10 in 2007 to 23 in 2012. As the data primarily relies on agency self-reporting, this is likely a low estimate.\n",
      "To his credit, President Trump has taken an aggressive approach to reining in the excess of the regulatory state. More than any of his recent predecessors, he is responsible for reducing burdensome regulations and emphasizing restraint on new regulations promulgated under his administration.\n",
      "But as the rumpus over at CFPB suggests, the bureaucracy fights back. When Trump is vindicated in court, as he is likely to be, he should be encouraged to further curtail the authority of independent agencies to assert their will on an unsuspecting public without critical oversight.\n",

      "WASHINGTON ― When Joe Arpaio, the former Maricopa County sheriff, announced his Senate candidacy on Tuesday, he became the fourth viable Republican 2018 congressional candidate who's been convicted of a crime. And like two of the other GOP cons running for office, he has cited his criminal record as a partial justification for his candidacy.\n",
      "Arpaio was convicted of misdemeanor criminal contempt of court in July 2017 for defying a court order requiring him to stop illegally detaining people he suspected of being undocumented immigrants based on their race. President Donald Trump pardoned him one month later.\n",
      "The other convicted criminals running for office as Republicans are Don Blankenship, the former head of the coal mining company Massey Energy who is running in the Republican primary to challenge Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.); former Rep. Michael Grimm, who is challenging incumbent Rep. Dan Donovan (R-N.Y.) to reclaim the Staten Island congressional seat he once held; and Rep. Greg Gianforte (R-Mont.), who is running for re-election.\n",
      "Bloomberg via Getty Images Don Blankenship is running for Senate in West Virginia as a Republican after serving a one-year sentence in prison for conspiracy to evade mine safety laws that led to the deaths of 29 miners.\n",
      "Blankenship served one year in prison on a misdemeanor conviction for conspiring to evade safety laws after the death of 29 miners at his Upper Big Branch Mine in 2010. Grimm, a former FBI agent, pleaded guilty to felony tax evasion in 2014. And last year, Gianforte also pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault for body-slamming a reporter days before winning a 2017 special election. So far, the national Republican Party has said it supports Donovan over Grimm, but it is also backing Gianforte, who is the only one of these convicted candidates currently in office. The party has not endorsed anyone in either West Virginia or Arizona.\n",
      "The only Democrat with a record running for office is David Alcorn, convicted of stalking, who is one of nine candidates for the party's nomination in New Mexico's 2nd Congressional District. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee would not support Alcorn, saying \"he is not fit to run for office.\"\n",
      "The 'Politically Incorrect Prisoners' Brand\n",
      "Three of these men — Arpaio, Blankenship and Grimm — have suggested that their convictions show they were persecuted by the Obama administration for their political beliefs. The actual evidence suggests otherwise.\n",
      "Blankenship referred to himself as a \"political prisoner\" of the Obama administration and is seeking to rehabilitate his image through an electoral run. Grimm claims that he was a victim with \"the entire Obama Justice Department weaponized against me.\" And Arpaio called his conviction for refusing to follow a lawful court order a \"political witch hunt by holdovers in the Obama justice department.\" At a rally in Phoenix before Trump issued his pardon, the president asked the pro-Arpaio crowd, \"Was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?\"\n",
      "Stephanie Keith / Reuters Former Rep. Michael Grimm is trying to reclaim his seat after pleading guilty to felony tax evasion in 2014.\n",
      "It's not uncommon to see politicians attempt to spin investigations or convictions as some kind of attack on their politics or identity. But there is a certain type of Republican political candidate whose campaign rationale is directly wrapped up in their criminal or rule-breaking identity. These candidates claim, whether in truth or not, that they have been personally persecuted by the liberal establishment for either trying to run a business or defending the American people.\n",
      "The trailblazer for this type of candidacy was Oliver North, the National Security Council staffer under President Ronald Reagan who shot to conservative stardom after his defiant congressional testimony about how he helped illegally fund the right-wing Contras militias in Nicaragua by selling arms to Iran. North was convicted of three felonies for his part in the scandal, although the convictions would later be vacated after an appeals court found that his immunized congressional testimony had been improperly used in his criminal trial. He captured the Republican Party nomination for a Virginia Senate seat in 1994 off his Iran-Contra fame.\n",
      "Mark Reinstein via Getty Images Oliver North became a conservative star after he defiantly admitted to breaking the law in the Iran-Contra scandal. His supporters rallied to his side ahead of his sentencing hearing in 1989.\n",
      "And although former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice Roy Moore was never convicted or charged with any crime, his political star rose after he was kicked out of his judicial seat twice. He was first removed from office in 2003 for refusing to comply with an order to remove a monument to the Ten Commandments from courthouse property. Then in 2016 he was kicked off the state court for refusing to acknowledge the Supreme Court's ruling legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide. These actions, which he and his supporters perceived as anti-Christian persecution, made him a star among a large enough group of conservatives in the state to win the Republican nomination for Senate in a 2017 special election.\n",
      "Among the current crop of convicted criminal candidates claiming political persecution, Arpaio stands out as the one with the most convincing appeal to right-wing Republican voters. Many of these voters agree with Trump that Arpaio was convicted for just doing his job. While the Arpaio pardon has polled poorly overall, strong supporters of Trump back it. A national poll by YouGov found that 61 percent of strong Trump supporters approved of the Arpaio pardon. A poll of Arizona residents by OH Predictive Insights found 50 percent of respondents opposed to the pardon, but did not release data based on partisan affiliation or presidential approval. Republican politicians in Arizona including Gov. Doug Ducey and Rep. Andy Biggs praised Trump for pardoning Arpaio. But Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), whom Arpaio is running to replace, said he wished Trump had not pardoned the ex-sheriff.\n",
      "Like Ollie North, Arpaio was just trying to protect Americans, in the eyes of this block of voters. They support his lawless brand of law enforcement. Like Roy Moore, Arpaio's crime was being politically incorrect. (Moore may have committed other, real crimes, but his devotees didn't find out about those allegations of sexually assaulting teen girls until after he'd won the Republican nomination.) Arpaio's crime and the conviction fit his brand. A poll released Tuesday night found Arpaio jumping to a statistical tie for first place in the Republican primary.\n"

      "Teams from multiple schools, including Neveln, Southgate, and IJ Holton, competed to see whose robot took home top honors in an event Neveln's robotics coach said was the first of its kind in the district for younger students.\n",

      "But is it? The short answer is, no. It's just another excuse by Republican leadership to be, you guessed it, lazy.\n",
      "Here's why.\n",
      "In 2013 and again in 2016, the filibuster was eliminated for nominations. This means that 60 votes are no longer required to get to a confirmation vote. However, the cloture requirement still exists. That is, the Senate must achieve cloture (with a simple majority) before they are able to vote on a nomination.\n",
      "Cloture comes with a waiting game, in the form of, at most, 30 hours. These hours are allowed for debate, and must transpire in between achieving cloture, and voting to confirm the nomination.\n",
      "The first thing to know about cloture is that each senator is only allowed to give two speeches. And the two speeches cannot total more than one hour.\n",
      "The second thing to know is that 30 hours is the maximum time for debate. It can be far less, for example, if 30 Democrat senators don't use all their time for debate.\n",
      "However, it's been the complaint of Republicans this year that Democrats are hell-bent on running all 30 hours, which is intended to limit the number of nominees that Republicans can process to no more than four or five a week.\n",
      "What does \"running\" for 30 hours look like? In the Lazy Senate, it looks the same as the Senate doing nothing.\n",
      "The hours are intended to allow senators to debate, but no debate happens. Quite literally, absolutely nothing happens. The Senate floor sits empty, locked into an endless quorum call.\n",
      "What goes on in the 30 hours — what does happen, and what could actually happen — is the difference between a lazy Senate, and a Senate that wants to do the work necessary to get its president's nominees confirmed.\n",

The donations would allow residents to reduce their state income tax payments and also receive a federal charitable tax deduction.\n",

      "In a letter dated December 2017, Ron Joyce Jr., son of company co-founder Ron Joyce, and his wife, Jeri Horton-Joyce, who is Tim Hortons' daughter, told employees at two Tim Hortons restaurants they own in Cobourg, Ont., that as of Jan. 1, they would no longer be entitled to paid breaks, and would have to pay at least half of the cost of their dental and health benefits.\n",

      "While the changes announced in the letter are not a violation of Ontario's Employment Standards Act, Wynne said she wants Joyce Jr. to reverse his decision.\n",

The initiative was part of a safety redesign of the roadway under Mayor de Blasio's \"Vision Zero\" initiative to eliminate pedestrian deaths and encourage alternative transportation citywide.\n",
      "Community Board 11 initially approved the DOT's bike lane proposal in June, but the advisory board rescinded that approval in September after requests to review safety issues went unanswered.

The study, released in early December, analyzed four possibilities. Out of those, consultants found that an \"Orange\" tunnel option would be feasible, but expensive.\n",
      "\"In Syracuse, we will do a DEIS for Route 81 as a tunnel and/or a community grid so we can look at both options, \" Cuomo said in his State of the State speech in Albany on Wednesday. Syracuse's new mayor, Ben Walsh, and Onondaga County Executive Joanie Mahoney were in attendance.\n",

      "What happens when you don't build natural gas pipelines? A really, really bad chain reaction, magnified during winter and peak demand. With a pipeline shortage, a natural gas shortage is created, prices for both natural gas and electricity skyrocket, and CO2 emissions go up because more carbon-intensive fuels are forced to compensate.\n",
      "Centered in New York, New Jersey and New England (hereafter collectively described as the Northeast), the devastating consequences of the anti-pipeline business just popped up again as we faced the coldest temperatures since the Polar Vortex of 2013-2014. Two fellow writers recently knocked this issue outta the park again in pieces for FORBES, so see them for mind-blowing stats on price spikes:\n",
      "Let me just say that natural gas prices in some parts of the Northeast boomed 60-70 times their recent rates because there's not enough pipeline capacity in the region to bring in natural gas in times of high demand. After years of warnings, this remains a massive problem: Gas is increasingly being utilized in the Northeast for generating both electricity and heat. For example, gas provides over half of the power in the region, despite no significant gas-producing state there.\n",
      "With such gas shortages, heating oil was forced to make up about 35% of New England's electricity during the time, which is highly problematic for those in the region that promote themselves as \"climate leaders\" but continually block new gas pipeline capacity: heating oil's CO2 emissions are 30-40% higher than those for natural gas.\n",
      "Indeed, bad policy helps explain why yearly home electricity rates in the Northeast average about 19 or 20 cents per kWh, compared with the national average of 12-13 cents. But beyond shattering family budgets, higher prices devastate business. Electricity, after all, isn't a luxury but an indispensable good: \"It cannot not be used.\" Overly high costs are just one reason why six of the 10 \"worst states for business\" as ranked by Chief Executive\n",

      "(ABC 6 News) -- Dozens of Austin elementary school students took part in a robotics tournament at Neveln Elementary School Saturday, learning the ropes before a larger tournament takes place at Austin High School later this month.\n",
      "Teams from multiple schools, including Neveln, Southgate, and IJ Holton, competed to see whose robot took home top honors in an event Neveln's robotics coach said was the first of its kind in the district for younger students.\n",
      "\"This is the only tournament we do with the elementaries, and so it's giving kids on the teams a chance to feel what the real tournament is like, \" coach Clint Phillips said.\n",
      "Students work in teams to build, program and then test the robots, which they then put up against other teams. While that might sound simple, it involves weeks of planning.\n",
      "\"You spend like 5-6 weeks building the robot by itself, and then you have to build the track and everything and you have to get the hang of driving it, \" Jazmin Conner, a 4th grader at Southgate, said.\n",
      "\"I always liked building and this should be really fun for me, \" Naryk Rector, a 4th grader at Neveln, said.\n",
      "And while it may be disguised as fun, the students are learning quite a bit, Phillips said, including skills that will help them regardless of what they do in the future.\n",
      "\"I see it as basic problem solving that the kids are doing, \" he said. \"This is a pretty complicated activity they're doing and they're having to break it down into smaller chunks which is a great skill that I think any employer would look for in an adult.\"\n",
      "That learning isn't lost on the kids, either.\n",
      "\"When you're older, you'll know some engineering to build robots, maybe if you want to start building robots that help people, \" 5th grader Gavin Brekke said.\n",
      "Following Saturday's tournament, a statewide tournament will be held at Austin High School on January 20, bringing together 24 teams from all over Minnesota.\n"

      "The New Year is upon us, and who knows, this might be your best year yet. Here are a few tips that I hope will be helpful to you as you get ready to tackle 2018:\n",
      "Take some time to really learn about yourself. Take the Clifton StrengthsFinder or the Meyers-Briggs or any one of a number of terrific assessment tools out there and find out how you are wired. Learn what your signature strengths are. Most of us are wholly unaware of what we are pre-wired to do in this world. Don Clifton, the Grandfather of Positive Psychology and the inventor of the Clifton StrengthsFinder once said \"Everyone on the planet can do at least one thing better than ten thousand other people. That's the good news. The bad news? Most people have no idea what that one thing is.\"\n",
      "It's easy to delude ourselves, or live somebody else's version of life. People do it all the time. Their mothers convince them they can sing and they believe them and then wind up on YouTube forever after a really embarrassing audition on American Idol. That same person who is at best a mediocre singer might be a world-class writer or leader, or the best accountant in history. We all have blind spots. Do everything you can to get an honest assessment. Then, act on it, and see what happens.\n",
      "Dream a little\n",
      "When was the last time you really let yourself dream? If you could wave a wand over your life and make the changes in 2018 that are necessary to make that come to pass, what changes would you make? Then, ask yourself, what's stopping me? Most hurdles are not real, but imagined. Kick them over and go to the places you were meant to go to in life.\n",
      "Less than half of us, by our own admission, get to do what we do best every day. Half. Just think how the world would change if we could all find that role in the world that allows us to do what we do best at least most of the time. We'd surely be more productive and happier, and probably healthier, too.\n",

      "Kathleen Sibert, president and CEO of Arlington Street People's Network (A-SPAN), presents Lora Rinker with a special award on the first year anniversary of the grand opening of the new Homeless Services Center (HSC) last October. Sibert explains that efforts to end homelessness in Arlington began 25 years ago when Rinker served meals from her front porch on N. Jackson Street in Arlington. Sibert said, \"This has been her vision for the last 25 years. It began with a warm heart and much love.\" Rinker's efforts have led to a full service year-round resource center that provides shelter, hygiene, mental health care, counseling and medical care. Sibert said, \"Kasia Shaw is our nurse practitioner. Kasia, raise your hand.\" Last season 129 people were treated for 343 medical visits. \"This center is the first of its kind in the D.C. area. Our end goal is to move people from homelessness to a home.\" Last year A-SPAN helped 70 homeless people find a home.\n",

      "The Douglaston Civic Association has for months vocally opposed bike lanes installed along Northern Boulevard that members say do more harm than good. But after their complaints to the city - including letters written, protests held and calls made to the mayor - were unsuccessful, the group is trying a new approach.\n",

      "The Department of Transportation installed the bike lanes along Northern Boulevard in September between 223rd Street and Douglaston Parkway, taking aways a lane of westbound traffic and resurfacing it. The initiative was part of a safety redesign of the roadway under Mayor de Blasio's \"Vision Zero\" initiative to eliminate pedestrian deaths and encourage alternative transportation citywide.\n",
      "Community Board 11 initially approved the DOT's bike lane proposal in June, but the advisory board rescinded that approval in September after requests to review safety issues went unanswered. A handful of locals have since called for the bike lanes' removal, claiming they are unsafe for both drivers and cyclists.\n",

      "The I-81 viaduct, which bisects the city and a public housing complex near Syracuse University's Main Campus, is considered structurally deficient in several spots.\n",
      "State officials are considering different replacement options for the stretch of highway. In 2016, the New York State Department of Transportation narrowed those options down to two from the 16 originally presented in 2014, eliminating several tunnel options from consideration.\n",
      "But under political pressure from New York State Senate Deputy Majority Leader, Republican John DeFrancisco, Cuomo in January 2017 announced that a consultant would conduct an independent study to review the possibility of tunneling underneath Syracuse. The study, released in early December, analyzed four possibilities. Out of those, consultants found that an \"Orange\" tunnel option would be feasible, but expensive.\n",
      "\"In Syracuse, we will do a DEIS for Route 81 as a tunnel and/or a community grid so we can look at both options, \" Cuomo said in his State of the State speech in Albany on Wednesday. Syracuse's new mayor, Ben Walsh, and Onondaga County Executive Joanie Mahoney were in attendance.\n",

The Orange route would pass underneath \"unused space\" at SU's steam station and chilled water plant, per the study.

      "Every year, I watch with increasing madness as something happens in the city of Boston. It's a an anger that overtakes every normally sane, reasonable person who lives in Boston and makes me begin to question my own sanity. It's that time of year: the time when Boston residents have to shovel their sidewalks.\n",
      "At this point most Bostonians expect a certain rhetorical turn, a turn toward yelling at all of your neighbors for either not plowing their sidewalks or doing a terrible job, causing inconvenience if you're lucky and worse if you're not. But I'm here to say it's time to put our petty sidewalk rivalries and anger behind us and focus it on someone who really deserves our ire.\n",
      "I'm talking about the city of Boston itself — that is, the municipal government.\n",
      "This is called \"A Sidewalk Plow, \" Boston. Many cities with significant snowfall have them.\n",
      "You see, where I come from originally, In Burlington, Vermont, sidewalks are given their due as what they really are: public rights of way that people need to traverse in order to get to work, school, or the grocery store. And while we can all agree your neighbor is a jerk for not shoveling your sidewalk, the truth is, this is Boston goddammit, and having a neighbor who is a thoughtless jerk isn't just possible — it's a guarantee. In Vermont, they came up with a solution for jerk neighbors that wasn't screaming their name futilely in the wind — it was making the city plow the sidewalks. When the city plows the sidewalks, people who are elderly, disabled, or just like getting to work without hurting themselves don't have to rely on their jerk neighbors, because they know they can rely on their city to plow the sidewalks.\n",
      "It's not just Vermont, either — Northern Cities such as Halifax , Ottawa, and Toronto all plow their sidewalks. (Apparently Canada takes better care of its city's thoroughfares.) It's true that other northern cities like Chicago and the Twin Cities expect \n"

      "\"This is the only tournament we do with the elementaries, and so it's giving kids on the teams a chance to feel what the real tournament is like, \" coach Clint Phillips said.\n",
      "Students work in teams to build, program and then test the robots, which they then put up against other teams. While that might sound simple, it involves weeks of planning.\n",
      "\"You spend like 5-6 weeks building the robot by itself, and then you have to build the track and everything and you have to get the hang of driving it, \" Jazmin Conner, a 4th grader at Southgate, said.\n",
      "\"I always liked building and this should be really fun for me, \" Naryk Rector, a 4th grader at Neveln, said.\n",
      "And while it may be disguised as fun, the students are learning quite a bit, Phillips said, including skills that will help them regardless of what they do in the future.\n",
      "\"I see it as basic problem solving that the kids are doing, \" he said. \"This is a pretty complicated activity they're doing and they're having to break it down into smaller chunks which is a great skill that I think any employer would look for in an adult.\"\n",

      "U.S. author and columnist Michael Wolff wrote in his controversial new book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House that Blair shared a \"juicy rumor\" with Trump's son-in-law \"that the British had the Trump campaign staff under surveillance, monitoring its telephone calls and other communications and possibly even Trump himself, \" the Times of London reported.\n",

      "Hunt did it as quickly as possible, smashing past the necessary 14 yards to pass Rams running back Todd Gurley (who sat out Week 17) with one total carry, his 35-yard touchdown run on Kansas City's opening possession against Denver.

The Chiefs didn't stand to gain anything (other than momentum) from a win over Denver, but with Charcandrick West out with an illness and only one other running back (Akeem Hunt) active, Kareem Hunt needed to be available. It became even more apparent when Akeem Hunt left the game with an ankle injury. That's how a team finishes the day with its fullback -- Anthony Spencer, who rushed 14 times for 40 yards and a score -- as its leading rusher.\n",

      "Both the House and Senate have passed their respective tax reform bills, but keep the cork in the champagne. The process has to overcome one more hurdle before it hits the president's desk: The conference committee — the ad hoc, temporary panel created to reconcile differences between the House and Senate bills.\n",
      "If you haven't heard of a conference committee for a while (or ever), it's understandable. Conference committees, once used repeatedly, are now rarely seen around D.C. In the 106th Congress (1999-2000), conference committees convened 38 times. The 113th Congress (2013-2014) appointed just three.\n",
      "In part, this is because the process has become far less meaningful than it used to be. Historically, conference committees have been hotbeds for deal making and hard-nosed negotiations among lots of members, with each chamber fighting for its priorities as well as its prestige. The conference committee for the 1981 omnibus budget reconciliation, for example, involved over 250 senators and congressman who met in 58 subconferences to consider nearly 300 issues.\n",
      "In the modern Congress, conference committees tend to be much smaller. Much like the debate in the respective chambers, the conference process is now tightly controlled by leadership with the final product negotiated by a handful of staff, out of sight, and conferees appointed mostly for show.\n",
      "Despite an effort by leadership to control the outcome, however, the conference process invokes new variables that could lead to a significantly modified bill.\n",

      "Meanwhile, the Trump administration has vowed to strengthen the United States' relations with Taiwan and has floated the idea of U.S. naval visits to the islands, prompting Li Kexin, a minister at the Chinese Embassy in Washington, to threaten that \"the day a U.S. navy vessel arrives in Kaohsiung is the day that our People's Liberation Army (PLA) unifies Taiwan with military force.\"\n",
      "The ratcheting up of tension across the Taiwan Strait is a reminder that the island democracy, which Beijing claims is a province of China, remains a center of gravity in East Asia. But it also raises a question: can China really take over Taiwan?\n",
      "For years, most analysts in the United States generally accepted the idea that Taiwan's status as a de facto independent democracy was unsustainable as China's economy and military rose to dominate Asia. Statesmen such as the late Singaporean leader Lee Kuan Yew and Henry Kissinger both predicted that Taiwan's unification with China — under Chinese terms — was inevitable. Hastening this trend was the sense among many senior U.S. officials that Taiwan was more a roadblock to Washington's smo\n",

      "(ABC 6 News) -- Dozens of Austin elementary school students took part in a robotics tournament at Neveln Elementary School Saturday, learning the ropes before a larger tournament takes place at Austin High School later this month.\n",
      "Teams from multiple schools, including Neveln, Southgate, and IJ Holton, competed to see whose robot took home top honors in an event Neveln's robotics coach said was the first of its kind in the district for younger students.\n",
      "\"This is the only tournament we do with the elementaries, and so it's giving kids on the teams a chance to feel what the real tournament is like, \" coach Clint Phillips said.\n",
      "Students work in teams to build, program and then test the robots, which they then put up against other teams. While that might sound simple, it involves weeks of planning.\n",
      "\"You spend like 5-6 weeks building the robot by itself, and then you have to build the track and everything and you have to get the hang of driving it, \" Jazmin Conner, a 4th grader at Southgate, said.\n",
      "\"I always liked building and this should be really fun for me, \" Naryk Rector, a 4th grader at Neveln, said.\n",
      "And while it may be disguised as fun, the students are learning quite a bit, Phillips said, including skills that will help them regardless of what they do in the future.\n",
      "\"I see it as basic problem solving that the kids are doing, \" he said. \"This is a pretty complicated activity they're doing and they're having to break it down into smaller chunks which is a great skill that I think any employer would look for in an adult.\"\n",
      "That learning isn't lost on the kids, either.\n",
      "\"When you're older, you'll know some engineering to build robots, maybe if you want to start building robots that help people, \" 5th grader Gavin Brekke said.\n",
      "Following Saturday's tournament, a statewide tournament will be held at Austin High School on January 20, bringing together 24 teams from all over Minnesota.\n",

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n",
      "Democratic financier Tom Steyer announced Monday that he will forgo running for public office in 2018 and will instead focus on dumping more money on an effort to impeach President Donald Trump.\n",
      "Steyer, a former hedge fund manager and liberal philanthropist, ended months of speculation that he is running for governor in California. He will instead spend 2018 dumping millions of dollars on campaigns to unseat Republicans.\n",
      "\"My fight isn't just in California. My fight is for the removal of Donald Trump from office, and from power, \" Steyer said during a press conference in Washington, D.C.

      "In a year-end summary, one of our nation's major weekly news publications recently tweeted that one of its most-read articles featured former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev saying that it appeared that the world is preparing for war. This apparently came as a shock to the man who once controlled about half of the world's nuclear arsenal, but of course it shouldn't be a shock. Entropy, the gradual decline into disorder, is the natural state of both man and universes. Every nation, as part of its daily life, spends some portion of its time preparing to shore up order within its boundaries while defending itself from external entropy and existential threats. The only reason that it seems odd that the topic of war is so much in the news is that we have gone through such an abnormally long period of stability and international peace.\n",

Both world wars, and many other wars before them, brought about the extinction of nations and empires and the deaths of thousands or millions, depending on the time in which they were waged. In each of these historic cases, the cause of civilization was set back, with literacy, per capita income, and life expectancies dropping while entropy and chaos rose.\n",

      "The study, published Thursday in Geophysical Research Letters, reveals that a decline in ozone-depleting chemicals has resulted in 20 percent less depletion since 2005. Specifically chlorine levels declined by 0.8 percent each year between 2005 and 2016.\n",
      "\"We see very clearly that chlorine from [chlorofluorocarbons] is going down in the ozone hole, and that less ozone depletion is occurring because of it, \" Susan Strahan, lead author and atmospheric scientist from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said in a statement.\n",
      "The chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) Strahan referred to are ozone-depleting chemicals that were once used in aerosol sprays, blowing agents for foams and packing materials, and refrigerants. Chlorine causes ozone depletion as the sun's ultraviolet radiation breaks down the CFCs into chlorine.\n",
      "The hole in the ozone layer was first discovered in the 1980s. This layer of the atmosphere protects the Earth from ultraviolet radiation, which can cause skin cancer and cataracts, suppress immune systems and harm plants. Just two years after the hole was discovered, the world jumped quickly to solve the problem. Several nations signed the Montreal Protocol, which would ultimately ban CFCs, the chemicals responsible for destroying the ozone. Fast-forward decades later, and the ozone hole was measured at the smallest since 1988, NASA announced last November.\n",
      "Strahan's study is the first to look directly at measurements of chemicals to argue that the shrinking hole stems from the ban of CFCs. Using data since 2005 from the Microwave Limb Sounder on the Aura satellite, scientists gathered information on the amount of hydrochloric acid in the stratosphere, where the ozone layer is located. Hydrochloric acid is a chemical that forms once chlorine has destroyed the ozone itself.\n",

      "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) announced Friday that legalizing 2 million young undocumented illegal immigrant \"Dreamers\" would cost the U.S. government $25.9 billion over a 10-year period, The Washington Times reported Friday .\n",
      "Those costs would come from the tax, education and other benefits for which they would be eligible. In addition, the CBO said newly legalized Dreamers would be able to sponsor another 80,000 people from a process called chain migration. That allows non-nuclear family members to be eligible for immigration.\n",
      "Immigration-rights activists have argued that legalizing Dreamers would be an overall benefit to the U.S. economy by the higher taxes they would pay because of their legal status. But, the CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) reported that legislation before Congress could be costly to the government.\n",
      "\"In total, CBO and JCT estimate that changes in direct spending and revenues from enacting [the bill] would increase budget deficits by $25.9 billion over the 2018-2027 period, \" officials said in their analysis.\n",
      "The CBO also said of the 11 to 12 million illegal immigrants estimated to be in the U.S. presently, approximately 3.25 million of them would be eligible under the Dream Act.\n",
      "The Dream Act is a bill before Congress that allows for minors brought to the U.S. who had worked towards an education and kept a mostly clean record to apply for legal status. They would then be able to eventually apply for U.S. citizenship.\n",
      "The CBO numbers only reflected taxes paid and benefits granted and did not include a \"dynamic\" scoring which takes into account the broader benefits of the effects that could take place on the economy.\n",

      "What happens when you don't build natural gas pipelines? A really, really bad chain reaction, magnified during winter and peak demand. With a pipeline shortage, a natural gas shortage is created, prices for both natural gas and electricity skyrocket, and CO2 emissions go up because more carbon-intensive fuels are forced to compensate.\n",
      "Centered in New York, New Jersey and New England (hereafter collectively described as the Northeast), the devastating consequences of the anti-pipeline business just popped up again as we faced the coldest temperatures since the Polar Vortex of 2013-2014. Two fellow writers recently knocked this issue outta the park again in pieces for FORBES, so see them for mind-blowing stats on price spikes:\n",
      "Let me just say that natural gas prices in some parts of the Northeast boomed 60-70 times their recent rates because there's not enough pipeline capacity in the region to bring in natural gas in times of high demand. After years of warnings, this remains a massive problem: Gas is increasingly being utilized in the Northeast for generating both electricity and heat. For example, gas provides over half of the power in the region, despite no significant gas-producing state there.\n",
      "With such gas shortages, heating oil was forced to make up about 35% of New England's electricity during the time, which is highly problematic for those in the region that promote themselves as \"climate leaders\" but continually block new gas pipeline capacity: heating oil's CO2 emissions are 30-40% higher than those for natural gas.\n",
      "Indeed, bad policy helps explain why yearly home electricity rates in the Northeast average about 19 or 20 cents per kWh, compared with the national average of 12-13 cents. But beyond shattering family budgets, higher prices devastate business. Electricity, after all, isn't a luxury but an indispensable good: \"It cannot not be used.\" Overly high costs are just one reason why six of the 10 \"worst states for business\" as ranked by Chief Executive\n",

      "Superfund cleanups can take decades, and some of the sites taken off of the list had their work started in the 1980s.\n",
      "There is often a delay in removing sites from the Superfund list due to administrative actions and pollution monitoring that must take place after work is complete, AP said.\n",

      "Agencies are facing an increasing mound of debt — a different type of debt than you may be thinking.\n",
      "Part of buying down that debt is understanding where to start, and that's where new standards from the Consortium for IT Software Quality (CISQ) could help.\n",
      "Bill Curtis, the executive director CISQ, said his organization worked with experts to develop a new set of standards that could help agencies begin to lower agency technical debt by focusing on fixing a broad set of known problems in software code.\n",
      "\"There really weren't any other standards for that. We looked at ISO, but they really never got to the level of defining standards for measuring the structure problems in source code, \" Curtis said in an interview with Federal News Radio. \"We created those standards. They are out there. They are in use and being referenced in some federal contracts as options for what ought to be used for as acceptance criteria as service level agreements about the quality of the system in various areas like security, reliability and performance. Based on the fact that these standards are built from counting known problems in the code that you have to fix, it's not every potential reliability or security problem, but the severe ones that you know you have to get out of the code. Those represent a form of technical debt.\"\n",
      "Then, Curtis said CISQ asked software experts to estimate how long it would take to fix those kinds of defects at the most basic architecture level. Finally, CISQ looks at the complexity through a static analysis tool to adjust the level of effort based on the complexity and level of effort and come up with a cost of what it would take to fix each defect.\n",
      "\"What you get is looking at quality of code and the amount of effort it will take to fix the most severe problems, you get an estimate of the technical debt, \" he said. \"If someone delivers a system to me I can analyze it and look at the amount of technical debt they just delivered to me to see what it will cost me t\n"

      "(ABC 6 News) -- Dozens of Austin elementary school students took part in a robotics tournament at Neveln Elementary School Saturday, learning the ropes before a larger tournament takes place at Austin High School later this month.\n",
      "Teams from multiple schools, including Neveln, Southgate, and IJ Holton, competed to see whose robot took home top honors in an event Neveln's robotics coach said was the first of its kind in the district for younger students.\n",
      "\"This is the only tournament we do with the elementaries, and so it's giving kids on the teams a chance to feel what the real tournament is like, \" coach Clint Phillips said.\n",
      "Students work in teams to build, program and then test the robots, which they then put up against other teams. While that might sound simple, it involves weeks of planning.\n",
      "\"You spend like 5-6 weeks building the robot by itself, and then you have to build the track and everything and you have to get the hang of driving it, \" Jazmin Conner, a 4th grader at Southgate, said.\n",
      "\"I always liked building and this should be really fun for me, \" Naryk Rector, a 4th grader at Neveln, said.\n",
      "And while it may be disguised as fun, the students are learning quite a bit, Phillips said, including skills that will help them regardless of what they do in the future.\n",
      "\"I see it as basic problem solving that the kids are doing, \" he said. \"This is a pretty complicated activity they're doing and they're having to break it down into smaller chunks which is a great skill that I think any employer would look for in an adult.\"\n",
      "That learning isn't lost on the kids, either.\n",
      "\"When you're older, you'll know some engineering to build robots, maybe if you want to start building robots that help people, \" 5th grader Gavin Brekke said.\n",

      "LONDON — Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has rejected a claim that he warned Jared Kushner that British intelligence might have spied on President Trump's staff during the 2016 presidential election.\n",
      "U.S. author and columnist Michael Wolff wrote in his controversial new book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House that Blair shared a \"juicy rumor\" with Trump's son-in-law \"that the British had the Trump campaign staff under surveillance, monitoring its telephone calls and other communications and possibly even Trump himself, \" the Times of London reported.\n",

      "\"This story is a complete fabrication, literally from beginning to end. I've never had such conversation in the White House, outside of the White House, with Jared Kushner, with anybody else, \" he said.\n",

      "The city of Los Angeles filed lawsuits Monday against three trucking companies that haul goods at Southern California ports, alleging they denied wages and benefits to drivers by illegally classifying them as independent contractors rather than employees.\n",
      "The lawsuits seek to bar the three companies from classifying drivers as independent contractors that allegedly should have been full-time employees. Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer said the practice is common among the roughly 1,000 trucking fleets operating at the Port of Los Angeles, the nation's busiest gateway for imports. Contractors aren't eligible for benefits owed to employee drivers, including unemployment insurance, workers' compensation and overtime pay. The lawsuits ask that the companies compensate drivers for back pay and pay civil penalties of up to $2,500 per violation.\n",

      "Banks thus have few options but go back to \"to the age of active headhunting, \" said O'Sullivan.\n",

      "The Whales|Tohora exhibition , at approximately 740 square metres, opens at Telus Spark on Jan. 20 for five months. It features two massive sperm whale skeletons, a giant replica of a blue whale's heart and other artifacts that kids can press and touch, to provide visitors with an immersive education about whales and their connection to Maori culture.\n",
      "The exhibition, presented by the National Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, has been touring around North America since 2008. With previous stints at the Ontario Science Centre in Toronto during 2010-2011 and the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa in 2012, Calgary will be the final stop on its North American tour.\n",
      "\"Especially being a landlocked city as well, we're not exposed to whales so this is a great opportunity for people like us who live in Calgary, a very dry climate, to be able to experience something that's new and something that we're not used to seeing every day, \" said Jacqueline Tran, a spokeswoman for Telus Spark. \"It can teach us about the vast scale of (whales), the biology, adaptation, the diversity of whales as well.\"\n",

      "The champagne corks are popping now that Republicans have passed the first significant tax overhaul in 30 years. While it's certainly not the sweeping reform that the GOP initially wanted, 80 percent of American households will be able to keep more of their own money. That's a good thing.\n",
      "What's less good is the process by which they got there, and what it means for the state of modern fiscal conservatism.\n",
      "In order to pass tax reform, Republicans are deliberately choosing to undo the fiscal accountability measures that many of them voted to implement less than 10 years ago.\n",
      "In 2010, a Democrat majority voted to institute the statutory pay-as-you-go law, or Paygo. The law requires that tax cuts or other legislation be paid for, or else spending cuts are automatically triggered at the end of the year.\n",
      "Democrats never intended for Paygo to actually cut spending. Rather, they wanted to use it to block future GOP tax reform. In spite of this, Paygo is one of several statutory controls on spending that the GOP could use to its benefit.\n",
      "The tax bill is estimated to add at least $1.5 trillion in new debt over the next 10 years, and thus, would trigger $136 billion in mandatory Paygo spending cuts. (Notably, the Paygo law limits the amount of money that can be cut from Medicare, Social Security and other low-income programs.)\n",
      "However, congressional Republicans appear on track to do two things to get around these fiscal accountability measures.\n",
      "First, they'll delay sending it to the president for his signature. If fully passing the bill in 2017 will trigger the automatic cuts, then why not wait until 2018 to sign it? Congress is not required to immediately send bills to the president for his signature, and Trump's own economic advisor, Gary Cohn, noted that Trump will delay signing the bill in order to avoid Paygo spending cuts.\n",
      "Second, congressional Republicans will vote to waive the Paygo requirements as part of the continuing resolution they pass at the end of the year, li\n",

      "Republican leaders are considering skipping passage of a GOP budget this year — a blow to the party's weakened fiscal hawks that would squash all 2018 efforts to revamp entitlements or repeal Obamacare.\n",
      "White House and Hill GOP leaders discussed the possibility of forgoing the painful budget process during last weekend's Camp David legislative summit, according to four sources familiar with the talks. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has argued that he cannot pass controversial deficit-reduction legislation using powerful budget procedures with his new 51-vote majority — and wasn't even sure he could find the votes for a fiscal blueprint in the first place.\n",
      "Story Continued Below\n",
      "Abandoning the budget, however, would be an embarrassment for Republicans, who for years railed against Democrats when they avoided one of the most basic responsibilities of Congress.\n",
      "But more importantly, it would mean the GOP's 2018 agenda would be sharply limited: Only with passage of a joint House-Senate budget can Republicans deploy reconciliation tools, which allow them to circumvent the Senate filibuster and bypass Democrats, as they did on last year's successful tax bill and failed Obamacare repeal push.\n",
      "That means no entitlement reform or welfare overhaul in 2018, a key priority for fiscal conservatives eager to shrink the now $20 trillion federal debt. Instead, President Donald Trump wants to focus on enacting a massive infrastructure package with help from Democrats. And conservatives are not happy about it.\n",

      "Specifically, disclosure laws should be changed to make sure they allow citizens to keep tabs on public officials rather than enable officials to oversee citizens. Current disclosure thresholds should be raised significantly. Disclosure requirements for independent speech should be limited significantly, given that such mandates do not serve traditional justifications for disclosure.\n",
      "This paper urges a more critical and balanced look at the issue, especially concerning disclosure requirements for independent political speech (i.e., speech that is not coordinated with candidates). Of primary focus is the Court's jurisprudence in this area, which is often invoked to support additional compulsory donor disclosure laws but lacks coherence, especially as it applies to independent speech. Even assuming that the Court's jurisprudence in this area remains sound, many arguments being advanced for compulsory donor disclosure laws are untethered from the justifications the Court has articulated, rendering them especially susceptible to challenge in litigation. This paper concludes with recommendations on how, and how not, to enact disclosure laws.\n",
      "Since the Supreme Court's 2010 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, proponents of stricter campaign finance regulation have increasingly prescribed \"disclosure\" as an antidote to \"dark money\" in politics. Advocates of more extensive donor disclosure laws typically invoke Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis's famous maxim that \"sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants, \" but they seldom acknowledge the harm of excessive sunlight.\n",
      "Paraphrasing Martin Luther King Jr.'s immortal words, federal appellate court judge Janice Rogers Brown recently observed that \"[t]he arc of campaign finance law has been ambivalent, bending toward speech and disclosure.\" But these two values, she noted, \"exist in unmistakable tension\" with each other. 1 This paper will closely examine this tension between speech and disclosure\n",

      "A complex proposal to help Californians evade a provision in President Trump's federal tax plan faces key questions even as its author is working toward the bill's speedy passage: How much would the plan ease Californians' new tax burdens, and would the Trump administration let it happen?\n",
      "The state legislation would create a state-run nonprofit, the California Excellence Fund, to accept donations to fund schools, road repairs and everything else in the state budget. The donations would allow residents to reduce their state income tax payments and also receive a federal charitable tax deduction.\n",
      "The bill's author, State Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles), introduced the measure this month after Trump signed an overhaul of the federal tax code. The federal plan caps state and local tax deductions at $10,000, a blow to residents in high-tax California.\n",
      "De Leon hopes the nonprofit gambit will preserve Californians' federal tax deductions and keep state revenue stable.\n",

      "In a letter dated December 2017, Ron Joyce Jr., son of company co-founder Ron Joyce, and his wife, Jeri Horton-Joyce, who is Tim Hortons' daughter, told employees at two Tim Hortons restaurants they own in Cobourg, Ont., that as of Jan. 1, they would no longer be entitled to paid breaks, and would have to pay at least half of the cost of their dental and health benefits.\n",

      "Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has denied claims that during the 2016 presidential elections he warned Jared Kushner that British intelligence may have spied on President Trump's staff. Buzz60\n",
      "LONDON — Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has rejected a claim that he warned Jared Kushner that British intelligence might have spied on President Trump's staff during the 2016 presidential election.\n",
      "U.S. author and columnist Michael Wolff wrote in his controversial new book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House that Blair shared a \"juicy rumor\" with Trump's son-in-law \"that the British had the Trump campaign staff under surveillance, monitoring its telephone calls and other communications and possibly even Trump himself, \" the Times of London reported.\n",
      "Wolff also speculated that Blair wanted to be Trump's Middle East envoy, according to the Guardian.\n",
      "More: Trump says Steve Bannon 'lost his mind' when he was fired\n",
      "Blair, who was prime minister from 1997 to 2007, dismissed both claims in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today program.\n",
      "\"This story is a complete fabrication, literally from beginning to end. I've never had such conversation in the White House, outside of the White House, with Jared Kushner, with anybody else, \" he said.\n",
      "Blair, who was from 2007 to 2015 the special representative for the quartet of international powers — the United Nations, the U.S, the European Union, and Russia — seeking an Israel-Palestinian peace deal, said he had met Kushner, Trump's Middle East peace envoy, about other issues.\n",
      "More: Exclusive: Tony Blair sees dangerous times ahead for Western democracies\n",
      "\"Of course I've met him and we discussed the Middle East peace process, \" he said. \"I wasn't angling for some job. I did the quartet role. I'm still very active on the Middle East peace process, but I'\n",

      "\"He came to me and he wanted to play and he wanted to do this thing , \" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said of Hunt, via ESPN. \"I fought him a little bit on it, and he won that fight. He told me he'd get it taken care of quick, and he did that. My hat goes off to him.\"\n",
      "Hunt did it as quickly as possible, smashing past the necessary 14 yards to pass Rams running back Todd Gurley (who sat out Week 17) with one total carry, his 35-yard touchdown run on Kansas City's opening possession against Denver. One carry, one league lead, one touchdown, one risk taken, one injury avoided and one desire fulfilled. Simple enough.\n",
      "Hunt was also called into duty out of need. The Chiefs didn't stand to gain anything (other than momentum) from a win over Denver, but with Charcandrick West out with an illness and only one other running back (Akeem Hunt) active, Kareem Hunt needed to be available. It became even more apparent when Akeem Hunt left the game with an ankle injury. That's how a team finishes the day with its fullback -- Anthony Spencer, who rushed 14 times for 40 yards and a score -- as its leading rusher.\n",
      "\"I just had to be ready, \" Kareem Hunt said. \"We were low on numbers at the running back position. Akeem and Sherm were the only guys there, so I had to dress and have their backs.\"\n",
      "Hunt had their backs, and the top spot on the league's rushing list. Not bad for a guy from the MAC.\n",

      "Arsene Wenger will name Alexis Sanchez in his starting Arsenal lineup for Wednesday night's Carabao Cup semi-final first leg at Chelsea, despite the uncertainly over the forward's future after Manchester City made a £20m offer to sign him during the January transfer window.\n",
      "Voodoo message told Romelu Lukaku to leave Everton for Chelsea, says Moshiri Read more\n",
      "Wenger has been rocked by the loss of Mesut Ozil to an unspecified injury and the midfielder has joined Laurent Koscielny, Nacho Monreal, Sead Kolasinac, Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud on the casualty list for Stamford Bridge. Wenger is particularly stretched in defence and he will include the new signing Konstantinos Mavropanos among his substitutes. The 20-year-old centre-half arrived last week from PAS Giannina in Greece and Wenger's plan was to loan him out. \"He's not ready to play for us, \" the manager said last Wednesday. \"We'll give him out on loan.\"\n",
      "David Ospina will start against Chelsea, in place of the first-choice goalkeeper, Petr Cech, but Wenger will otherwise pick his strongest available team, including Sanchez.\n",
      "City have wanted Sanchez since the summer, when they made an attempt to sign him, and, with the 29-year-old running down his Arsenal contract, they have been confident of signing him as a Bosman free agent at the end of the season. Pep Guardiola will be without Gabriel Jesus for two months because of a medial collateral ligament injury and this has increased the City manager's desire to sign Sanchez now. City have opened talks with Arsenal and have indicated a willingness to pay £20m.\n",
      "Sanchez, who played under Guardiola at Barcelona, is now permitted to discuss terms with overseas clubs, with Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich believed to have shown an interest. But City remain the frontrunners for his signature. A contract worth £13m a season until 2023 — or £250,000 a week — is understood to have been offered to Sanchez's representatives. Wenger was asked whether he expected Sanchez\n"
