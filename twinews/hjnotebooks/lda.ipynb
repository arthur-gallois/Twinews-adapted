It's unfortunate ... everyone has their ways of doing peaceful protest ... And as long as it's peaceful ... if every protest was peaceful, the world would be a better place, right? You may not necessarily agree with how someone is protesting, but as long as it's peaceful ... Now, saying that, would I kneel during the anthem? No. I don't think I would kneel during the anthem. But everyone has their own personal choice. I think people have lost sight of the fact of what someone is protesting about, and they are focusing on how they're protesting, which is unfortunate. But its an uncomfortable conversation. It's an uncomfortable conversation for a lot of people, and I don't know if anyone has the right answer.\"\n",
      "There you go. Jeter would not kneel, but he doesn't mind players doing so as long as the protest remains peaceful.\n",
      "Perhaps more importantly, Jeter says people have lost sight of why players are kneeling. The reason San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick — and now many other NFL players — started kneeling during the national anthem was to protest racial inequality in the United States. It wasn't to protest against the military or veterans as some may suggest.\n",
      "For the most part, kneeling protests haven't cropped up in baseball. The only player to engage in one thus far has been Oakland Athletics catcher Bruce Maxwell. The 26-year-old Maxwell was arrested Saturday night after allegedly pointing a gun at a woman. The A's released a statement saying they were disappointed in Maxwell's arrest, but were still gathering facts and wouldn't comment further.\n",
      "Maxwell began his protest near the end of the regular season. No player has taken a knee during the national anthem in the playoffs.\n",
      "Given the divisive political climate, that could change next season. The NFL protest started with just Kaepernick and safety Eric Reid, but evolved into something much bigger.\n",
      "There's been no indication that more baseball players will engage in any type of protest next season yet. But if they do, Jeter will be just fine with that decision.\n",

      "Hillary Clinton wins narrow victory over Michelle Obama\n",
      "Clinton has won the past 16 years; Obama the past 10\n",
      "WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Americans once again are most likely to name Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton as the man and woman living anywhere in the world they admire most, as they have for the past 10 years. The pair retain their titles this year, although by much narrower margins than in the past. Obama edges out Donald Trump, 17% to 14%, while Clinton edges out Michelle Obama, 9% to 7%.\n",

      "The 2017 survey marks the 16th consecutive year Clinton has been the most admired woman. She has held the title 22 times in total, more than anyone else. Eleanor Roosevelt is second with 13 wins. Obama has now been named the most admired man 10 times, trailing only Dwight Eisenhower, who earned the distinction 12 times. Obama won all eight years he was president, plus 2008 -- the year he was first elected -- and this year, his first as a former president.\n",
      "But Clinton's and Obama's standings this year are more tenuous than in the past. The 9% who name Clinton is the lowest percentage she has received since 2002, when 7% named her in another close first-place finish. Clinton won the title this year in the same poll she registered a personal low favorable rating. This indicates she remains top of mind for enough people who like her to be named more than any other woman in response to the open-ended question, finishing ahead of some women who may be better liked overall but are not as prominent in people's minds.\n",
      "The percentage of adults naming Obama as the most admired man is down from 22% last year, but he has been at or near 17% in several other years.\n",
      "A quarter of Americans cannot name a man or a woman they admire most. Nine percent name a relative or friend as the most admired man, and 13% do so for the most admired woman.\n",
      "Trump One of Small Number of Incumbent Presidents Not to Win Distinction\n",
      "Gallup has asked the most admired man question 71 times since 1946 -- all but in 1976. The incumbent president has won 58 of those times. Previous incumbent presidents who did not finish first include Harry Truman in 1946-1947 and 1950-1952, Lyndon Johnson in 1967-1968, Richard Nixon in 1973, Gerald Ford in 1974-1975, Jimmy Carter in 1980, and George W. Bush in 2008. All but Truman in 1947 and Ford in 1974 had job approval ratings well below 50%, like Trump.\n",
      "As would be expected for a Republican president, Trump wins handily among Republicans -- 35% name him as the man they admire most, with only 1% naming Obama. In contrast, Obama leads among Democrats, with 39% mentioning him and 3% Trump. Independents are slightly more likely to name Obama (12%) than Trump (9%).\n",
      "After Trump and Obama, the remainder of the top 10 list for men includes Pope Francis, Rev. Billy Graham (for a record 61st time), Sen. John McCain, Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk, Sen. Bernie Sanders, businessman and philanthropist Bill Gates, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and three men tied for 10th -- Vice President Mike Pence, the Dalai Lama and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Bezos and Musk made the top 10 this year for the first time.\n",
      "In addition to Graham, many of the other top 10 male finishers have been on the list numerous times, including Gates (18 times), Obama (12), the Dalai Lama (eight), Trump (seven), McCain (six) and Pope Francis (five).\n",
      "One notable person missing from the top 10 list this year is Bill Clinton, whose string of 25 consecutive top 10 finishes ended this year. Clinton was No. 1 on the list each of his eight years as president from 1993 to 2000.\n",
      "Oprah Winfrey Finishes in Top 10 for 30th Time\n",
      "Hillary Clinton has finished in the top 10 26 times, the fifth most among women. She trails two of this year's other top 10 finishers -- Queen Elizabeth II (who holds the record for women, with 49 appearances) and Oprah Winfrey (named for the 30th time, third behind former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 34 appearances and ahead of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' 28 during their lifetimes).\n",
      "Despite their frequent appearances on the list, neither the queen nor Winfrey has ever finished first. Queen Elizabeth II was second in 1952, 1957, 1958 and 1962. Winfrey has finished second 13 times, most recently in 2014.\n",
      "Joining Clinton, Queen Elizabeth II and Winfrey in the top 10 this year are Michelle Obama, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, first lady Melania Trump, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton and Beyonce Knowles. Trump, Haley and Knowles are new to the top 10. Rice has finished in the top 10 17 times, Obama 10 times, Merkel five times, and Warren and the duchess four times each.\n",
      "Clinton was the choice of 22% of Democrats, with Obama next at 12%. Among independents, Obama had 8% of mentions and Clinton 5%. No woman registered 5% among Republicans, with Rice named by 4% and Clinton, Trump and Haley named by 3%. Republicans are much more likely to name relatives (19%) than Democrats (9%) or independents (12%) are.\n",
      "Hillary Clinton has been named most admired more than any woman -- or man -- in Gallup's polling history. But the likelihood that she will continue to hold that honor in future years seems less certain, with her popularity at a nadir and the percentage naming her as most admired the lowest in 15 years. She managed to win this year because she remains arguably more prominent than other contenders. However, retaining that stature may be more challenging in coming years with her political career likely over.\n",
      "Trump's unpopularity is holding him back from winning the most admired distinction. The incumbent president is the usual winner, since he is arguably the most prominent figure in the country -- but when the president is unpopular, other well-known and well-liked men have been able to finish first. Obama, like Hillary Clinton, may fade in prominence the longer he is out of office. Former presidents commonly make the top 10 list but rarely win, with Obama only the second to do so, along with Eisenhower in 1967 and 1968.\n"

      "The sanctions had passed with overwhelming majorities in the House and Senate, but the State Department said they will not be put in place.\n",
      "Donald Trump is being called a \"traitor\" and accused of conspiring with Russia after the president refused to enact sanctions that had been passed with overwhelming majorities in the House and Senate.\n",
      "Last year, Trump had reluctantly signed the bill creating new sanctions on Russia for the country's interference in the 2016 presidential election. Reports from the intelligence community found that Russia purposely meddled in the election in the hope of helping Trump get elected, and a salacious dossier compiled by a former British spy claimed that Trump's campaign actively colluded with Russia.\n",
      "That led to quite a bit of attention around the new sanctions, which many feared Trump would not put into place.\n",
      "On Monday, the U.S. State Department said exactly that — despite the measures passing with overwhelming bipartisan support by Congress and being signed into law by Donald Trump, the department would not be putting them into place. An announcement from the department claimed that the sanctions were not needed as the sanctions currently in place already act as a deterrent to Russia.\n",
      "\"Today, we have informed Congress that this legislation and its implementation are deterring Russian defense sales, \" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said (via the New York Post). \"Since the enactment of the ... legislation, we estimate that foreign governments have abandoned planned or announced purchases of several billion dollars in Russian defense acquisitions.\"\n",
      "The announcement was met with harsh criticism and strong opposition from both sides of the aisle.\n",
      "\"When the Congress voted for this, the whole point of it was to slap sanctions on these Russian companies that interfered with our election and are doing all kinds of other things, \" said Democratic Congressman Eliot Engel, the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee (via the Daily Beast). \"The legislation itself is not a deterrent if you don't put teeth behind it. And the teeth behind it are the sanctions.\"\n",
      "Some had even more harsh words for Donald Trump's refusal to enact Russian sanctions. Democratic fundraiser and strategist Scott Dworkin, a frequent critic of Trump online, said that the decision amounted to treason and hinted that Trump must be being blackmailed by Russia.\n",
      ".@realDonaldTrump-America wants to know why you didn't implement Russian sanctions yet. Oh, because you're the biggest traitor in the history of this country. And you are still conspiring with the Russians to undermine the United States of America. That piss tape must be good... — Scott Dworkin (@funder) January 30, 2018\n",
      "There were already signs that Donald Trump was backing away from the Russian sanctions. As the Daily Beast noted, the State Department and Treasury Department missed an October 1 deadline to issue guidance on how the sanctions would be implemented, and then lawmakers asking about the delay were met with only silence.\n",
      "As a Member of the Foreign Affairs Cmte, I find the weakness shown by @realDonaldTrump towards Russia to be deeply troubling. Sanctions law was not just to deter Russia, but to hold it accountable for hacking our democracy. Russia shouldn't get a mulligan. — Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) January 30, 2018\n",
      "The decision not to enact Russian sanctions also comes as Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation appears to be circling closer to Donald Trump. Reports indicate that Mueller is focusing on whether Trump committed obstruction of justice and has requested an interview. As CNN reported, Trump initially indicated that he would sit for an interview, but Trump's lawyer later backed off the claim.\n",

      "\" I've been trying to articulate that same message [as your blog post] since 2008, and oddly enough, the greatest resistance has come from academic economists, or those with equivalent training, who believe that some model somewhere \"proves\" that the real natural rate always has to be the equal to the real potential growth rate, or has to be a real rate of 2%, or at least has to be positive given a positive marginal product of capital. What I've always said is that, at least for an open economy, since interest rates also interact with the exchange rate and both matter for growth/inflation, there's no simple rule of thumb like that.\"\n",
      "The first email was from an academic macroeconomist. He asked me if I thought that calls for normalisation from bank economists were motivated by bank profitability. I said I didn't know, but that if the Bank of Canada raised the actual interest rate r above the equilibrium natural rate of interest r * this would probably be bad for bank profitability in the long run. Because the Bank of Canada would eventually need to cut r below r * to prevent inflation falling below the 2% target. Plus it would likely cause r * to fall, relative to counterfactual, because it would reduce confidence that future aggregate demand would be strong enough to make current investment profitable. But if something caused r * to rise, and the Bank of Canada responded by raising r to keep inflation from rising above the 2% target, this might be good for bank profitability, and those hoping for normalisation needed to distinguish the two cases. (But even here it is not obvious to me what the effect on bank profits would be, because banks make profits off interest rate spreads, between borrowing and lending rates, and not on the level of interest rates, so you need to argue that a higher level of interest rates would prevent spreads being squeezed.)\n",
      "Avery is right to make that point about the interest rate and the exchange rate. For example, under perfect capital mobility where the domestic interest rate (adjusted for expected appreciation/depreciation of the exchange rate) equals the world interest rate, it is perfectly possible for the domestic growth rate to exceed the world growth rate and world rate of interest. But I'm not sure whether that argument can be made for Canada. So I want to set it aside for now, and say that the academic economists Avery is arguing with are wrong, even for a closed economy, like the world.\n",
      "First off, there is no one theory of the rate of interest. If you want to see just how numerous and diverse the theories are, I recommend you skim down this hilariously long recent Twitter thread by Jo Michell. Now we might say that a lot of those theories are false, and that some of them are different versions of each other. But I think it's more like the blind men and the elephant; each gets part of the truth, but none of them gets the whole truth\n",
      "Second, here's a really simple and obvious counterexample to the claim that theory says that the Canadian equilibrium real interest rate cannot be below the growth rate and cannot be negative. And it's one where we all know for certain what that equilibrium real interest rate must be. Hint: it's minus 2%, and all of us willingly hold that financial asset despite its negative real yield. That counterexample is currency, given the Bank of Canada's 2% inflation target, and the fact that the nominal rate on currency is stuck at 0%.\n",
      "Now you might say I'm cheating, because the real interest rate on currency is not what we are talking about when we talk about the Bank of Canada normalising interest rates. But currency is just an extreme example to illustrate a more general point: there are lots of different interest rates, because there are lots of different financial assets, and they are not all perfect substitutes for each other, and the yield spreads between those financial assets can vary over time, depending both on how their differences vary over time and on how people's valuations of those differences vary over time. Yield spreads depend on liquidity, term, and safety. And even safety is not a simple thing, since different people are concerned about different sorts of risk.\n",
      "And the three interest rates set by the Bank of Canada (the deposit rate, the bank rate, and the overnight rate) are very peculiar, and cannot be assumed to be representative of the whole spectrum of interest rates, even if we restrict our attention to Canadian interest rates. And \"the\" interest rate, to which a particular theory of interest rate applies, might be better proxied by an anticipated rate of return on equities, or even a rental yield on houses or farmland, than by an interest rate on promises to pay a fixed number of Canadian dollars.\n",
      "And, even if we do pick one Canadian dollar nominal interest rate, what real interest rate we get depends on what price index we use to define \"inflation\". Sraffa was right to say it doesn't make sense to tell the central bank to set the nominal interest rate equal to the natural rate, because there is a different natural rate for every price index. This does not mean a Neo-Wicksellian central bank cannot set a nominal interest rate equal to a natural rate plus a target rate of inflation (where both are defined using the same price index). But it does mean that any economic theorist who tells the Bank of Canada what the natural rate can or cannot be must make sure that the price index implicit in his theory matches the price index the Bank of Canada targets, or else make an adjustment so both are talking about the same real rate. And some such adjustment will almost certainly be needed, because the Bank of Canada targets a Consumer Price Index, and the prices of capital goods can vary relative to the prices of consumer goods, and any theory of interest rates in which investment is endogenous should include that relative price change. Lower interest rates mean higher house prices relative to rents, for example.\n",
      "The Theory of Capital and Interest is difficult, even if we ignore money and other complications. It is perfectly possible to have the real interest rate, defined by the price index of capital goods, equal to the Marginal Product of those Capital goods (defined using that same price index), and the latter being positive, but the real interest rate defined by the price index of consumption goods, being negative. All you need is the relative price of capital goods falling faster (or being expected to fall faster) than the own rate of return on capital goods. If robots can reproduce themselves at 10% per year then the robot rate of interest will be 10%. But if the price of robots is falling at 15% per year relative to consumption goods, the consumption rate of interest will be minus 5%.\n",
      "The rate of return on investment that matters for the consumption rate of interest is the Marginal Rate of Transformation between present consumption goods and future consumption goods. The simplest of such technologies is simple storage. If we can store consumption goods costlessly and safely then the consumption rate of interest cannot be negative, because if it were negative there would be arbitrage profits from storage. All forms of investment are just like storing apples, except that we first transform the apples into trees, and then back into apples. Or use the resources that could have produced apples for current consumption to produce something else to help us produce apples for future consumption. And we can sometimes get \"negative wastage\" of apples when we \"store\" them using those more \"roundabout\" methods. But if technology is improving in those roundabout methods, or if supply increases as we invest more, we will tend to see the relative prices of those goods falling over time. And if our consumption basket includes a rising proportion of services that cannot easily be stored, even metaphorically, the consumption basket interest rate will be less than the return on investment on goods that can be \"stored\", and will be falling over time. We end up singing each other songs, with all the other goods free. Which isn't so bad really, provided there are enough young people around to sing songs for us old retired folks. See my other post for an example.\n",
      "Which brings me to demographics.\n",
      "Most macroeconomic theories of interest rates are variations on the theme of productivity and thrift, with a bit of liquidity preference thrown into the mix though usually only for the short run. So let me talk about demographics and thrift, because saving for our retirement is a big motive.\n",
      "The textbook representative agent macroeconomic models do not have demographics. In the simplest case of a representative agent with log preferences, so the Marginal Utility of consumption equals 1/consumption, the real interest rate (measured in consumption goods) equals the growth rate of consumption, plus an allowance for innate impatience (\"pure\" time-preference \"proper\"). You can get an interest rate higher or lower than this if the Marginal Utlity of Consumption falls more or less quickly than 1% per 1% rise in consumption. But the real interest rate will not go negative unless consumption has negative growth or people have negative impatience (they prefer consuming 99 today and 101 tomorrow than 100 on both days).\n",
      "But that is growth rate in consumption per capita. Which will be less than growth rate in aggregate consumption, if the population is growing.\n",
      "But the biggest problem with this way of looking at thrift is that the representative agent lives forever, and never retires. The only way we can translate that model into a model of finite lives is to think of the representative agent as an infinitely-lived dynasty of parents, kids, grandkids, etc., each of whom is perfectly altruistic towards older and younger generations of the same family (and let's not even think about sex, which brings in the in-laws to mess things up). So parents care about their kids' and grandkids' consumption as much as they care about their own, and kids support their retired parents, and \"saving\" means all generations of the dynasty who are currently alive not collectively consuming part of their collective income. And even if we accept all this, if the representative parent has less than one kid (don't think about sex, or integer constraints), the dynasty might want to save, even at negative interest rates, to take the burden off the kid in supporting the parent's retirement.\n",
      "Overlapping generations (OLG) models, like Samuelson 1958, do explicitly incorporate demographics. And one interesting result of those models is that an economy with an interest rate below the growth rate is \"dynamically inefficient\". It means that the government (or someone) could set up an unfunded pension plan that pays a rate of return equal to the growth rate, and make all generations better off. It's like a Ponzi scheme, except it can run forever, because the liability grows at the same rate as GDP, so the implied debt/GDP ratio can stay constant and sustainable.\n",
      "But that deserves a post of its own, because this post is already too long. So I'm going to stop there, for now.\n"

      "White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly first found his credibility being challenged in October, when he leveraged his standing as a retired four-star Marine Corps general who had lost a son on the battlefield to try to contain a political crisis over President Trump's calls to the families of fallen soldiers.\n",
      "His reputation took another hit when he later refused to apologize for falsely attacking a Democratic congresswoman. And another when he called Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee \"honorable\" and blamed the Civil War on a lack of compromise. And yet another when early this week he said some immigrants known as \"dreamers\" were \"too lazy to get off their asses.\"\n",
      "Then came the Rob Porter saga.\n",
      "After the White House staff secretary was accused of domestic violence by both of his ex-wives, Kelly publicly defended Porter as \"a man of true integrity and honor, \" adding, \"I can't say enough good things about him.\" Privately, Kelly reportedly urged him to stay in his job.\n",
      "Kelly's actions left his critics — as well as some West Wing subordinates — questioning how much credibility he has left.\n",
      "\"To have a chief of staff defend the integrity of a person who's been credibly accused of being a wife beater is just stunning . . . and unconscionable, \" said Peter Wehner, who has served in the three previous Republican administrations and opposes Trump. \"What he's done as chief of staff doesn't undo what he did as a heroic war figure, but it diminishes him as a person, and that's regrettable.\"\n",
      "Kelly's luster has slowly eroded during his roughly six months as Trump's top staffer — and some White House aides worry it may be acutely painful, considering he takes personal pride in his honor as a lifelong public servant.\n",
      "John R. Allen, a retired four-star Marine Corps general and a close friend of Kelly's, said the political portrayal of Kelly by critics bears little resemblance to the leader he served alongside.\n",
      "\"This is a man who, across the Corps for 40 years, was considered to be the exemplar of moral principle and integrity, \" Allen said. \"He was a selfless servant in every possible way — a lot of personal courage, moral courage to do the right thing. His values were very powerfully formed, and it's just difficult for me to find in my memory of my service with him a flaw.\"\n",
      "The perception of Kelly as above politics has been critical to his success in the West Wing. Publicly, he has come to Trump's aid at moments of crisis, while privately he has been used to kill damaging news stories, or put a positive spin on them.\n",
      "But the irony for Kelly may be that the credibility that makes him a singular asset in this White House may have been irreparably damaged by his work in it. Some senior aides acknowledge this administration has a serious credibility problem, in part because of the president's erratic nature and propensity to utter falsehoods.\n",
      "Leon Panetta, a former defense secretary and White House chief of staff in Democratic administrations, served with Kelly under President Barack Obama and has observed him in recent months.\n",
      "\"He just appears to be more on edge these days, \" Panetta said of Kelly. \"That may be the result of frustration with dealing with issues and, in some ways, dealing with Trump. When you're a chief of staff, you spend a lot of time with this president. It starts to wear on you.\"\n",
      "In October, as part of his defense of Trump's engagement with Gold Star parents, Kelly lectured journalists on morality. \"When I was a kid growing up, a lot of things were sacred in our country, \" he said. \"Women were sacred, looked upon with great honor.\"\n",
      "This week, Kelly defended Porter on Tuesday after the Daily Mail published a detailed account of Porter's alleged abuse of his second wife. On Wednesday, after photographs of his first wife with a black eye surfaced, as well as more allegations from both women, Kelly stood by Porter, who has denied the allegations.\n",
      "Only after Porter announced he would resign, and with the matter blowing into a media firestorm, did Kelly issue a second statement. He claimed Wednesday night that he was \"shocked\" by the allegations — which the White House had known about generally since late last year — and added, \"There is no place for domestic violence in our society.\"\n",
      "Still, Kelly stood by his earlier praise for \"the Rob Porter that I have come to know.\"\n",
      "Top White House aides typically speak of Kelly with reverence, but spokespeople declined requests Wednesday evening and Thursday morning to speak for this article and discuss the ­questions surrounding Kelly's integrity.\n",
      "Chris Whipple, author of a history of White House chiefs of staff, said Kelly's management of the Porter situation reveals him to be \"politically inept.\"\n",
      "\"It's clear now that those expectations everybody had that Kelly would somehow be the grown-up in the room, a moderating force who would smooth the rough edges off of Trump, were just completely unrealistic, \" Whipple said.\n",
      "Kelly has been the target of some Trump loyalists, inside and outside the administration, who have taken issue with his moves to control access to the president. Two of these people noted privately that Kelly was far more vociferous in his defense of Porter than any White House staffer had been after the president was accused last month of having had an ­extramarital affair with porn star Stormy Daniels; one noted that spousal abuse is illegal but arranging \"hush money\" for a mistress is not.\n",
      "Although Trump has vented privately on occasion about Kelly's methods, the president has publicly lavished praise on his chief of staff.\n",
      "This was not Kelly's only brush with controversy this week. On Tuesday, the White House chief of staff described immigrants in language widely considered offensive if not racist.\n",
      "During a visit to the Capitol, Kelly posited an explanation for why hundreds of thousands of young immigrants had not yet applied for legal protections granted by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program: \"Some would say [they] were too afraid to sign up; others would say [they] were too lazy to get off their asses.\"\n",
      "This comes after Kelly waded into the emotionally and racially charged minefield of Civil War history in the fall. He called Lee \"an honorable man\" and attributed the conflict to \"the lack of an ability to compromise, \" adding that \"men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand.\"\n",
      "There also was the Oct. 19 news conference in which Kelly waxed about the degradation of societal values in the United States. That is when he excoriated Rep. Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.) for listening in on and then publicizing her account of Trump's call to Myeshia Johnson, the widow of one of the four soldiers killed in an ambush in Niger.\n",
      "Kelly said he was \"appalled\" that Wilson — a family friend of Johnson's — criticized Trump's tone and choice of words on the call, and he accused the congresswoman of speaking \"in the long tradition of empty barrels making the most noise.\"\n",
      "Kelly also falsely accused Wilson of grandstanding about her role winning funding for a new FBI building in Miami at its 2015 christening. Video of her remarks at the event showed he wrongly portrayed what she said, but Kelly refused to back down from his contention.\n",
      "Kelly, 67, was a decorated war commander with an unimpeachable reputation when he joined the Trump administration in January 2017 as secretary of homeland security. He was appointed White House chief of staff in late July.\n",
      "Few administration officials have been as vociferous in their defenses of Trump's character — as well as of his hard-line policy views on immigration and national security — than Kelly, who in turn has become a subject of occasional mockery and derision by critics of the president.\n",
      "\"To understand John Kelly is to understand that he is, first and foremost, a Marine and somebody who obviously has a lot of respect for the country and for whoever's the commander in chief, \" Panetta said. \"But he's also not a politician, and that means that what he says is not something that is screened through a kind of political spectrum.\"\n",
      "Kelly is only the latest Trump staffer to have their credibility take a beating in the eyes of some because of their work for the president.\n",
      "\"Almost everybody who gets into Donald Trump's orbit is stained by that, \" said Wehner, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center. \"Everyone who gets in his orbit is diminished, and their reputations are hurt. It's almost as predictable as the sun rising in the east and settling in the west.\"\n"

      "The kindergarteners rallied for three child prisoners in particular, a young girl named Razan Abu Sal, 13, who was sentenced to 13 and a half months and a fine of $870 (3000 NIS), Shadi Farrah, 12, who has already served two years of his three year sentence, and the infamous Ahed Tamimi, 17, who was detained (at age 16) on charges of incitement and slapping an Israeli soldier. She has become a worldwide symbol of child imprisonment and the Palestinian struggle for freedom.\n",
      "Activists with Human Rights Defenders, Badee Dwaik and Arif Jabar, organized the rally in one of the most contentious areas of Hebron, the Tel Rumeida neighborhood where Palestinians systematically experience violence from settlers, and the Israeli soldiers in the area tend to turn a blind eye, or back up those settlers.\n",
      "Badee Dwaik told the group that the demonstration marked the start of the annual campaign, \"Dismantle the Ghetto, \" an effort to publicize and protest the horrors of life under the illegal occupation in the city of Hebron. The campaign is a call for the lift the closures inside of the city and the suppression of its population. It will be held on the 24th anniversary of the massacre at the Ibrahimi mosque by Baruch Goldstein. On February 25, 1994, Goldstein opened fire on Palestinians worshippers inside of the mosque, killing 29.\n",
      "At the demonstration the children carried signs protesting the occupation, an all encompassing-word for the abuses and indignities that are carried out against them by Israeli soldiers and settlers. They chanted, \"every child deserves a childhood.\" They asked the international community to protect them and for international law to be upheld. They carried banners speaking of their anger at Israel and the Western countries that support Israel's racist, apartheid, colonial, occupation of the Palestinian people. Israel is the only country in the world today that maintains an apartheid regime.\n",
      "The demonstration culminated with settler attacks on two Palestinian journalists, Du'aa Yahya al-Atrash from Ma'an television and Zidan al-Sharbat. When the event ended, Israeli soldiers prevented the children from returning to their homes.\n",

Hassan even attempted to stop a Palestinian from filming the protest from inside his house even as he pleaded, \"I am in my own home. Get out of here!\"\n",

      "Baby, it's cold outside. Or at least it is as I write this, on a blustery January evening after driving around Orange County on a hunt for a meal to thaw the chill. Of course, by cold, I mean about 50 degrees, which is as frigid as winter in Southern California gets, but forgive the hyperbole; I haven't yet re-lit the pilot light in my apartment's wall heater and the arctic frost feels too real.\n",
      "Nights like these call for wool socks and comfort food, dishes that are not necessarily decadent or rich, but that are still hearty enough to warm you from the inside out. Since it opened in September, this has meant going to Yang's Braised Chicken Rice in Tustin, where tonight I melted into yet another steaming clay pot filled with the only thing this wildly successful one-dish Chinese fast food chain serves: the nourishing and addictive huang men ji.\n",
      "Huang men ji is a braised chicken stew, with juicy thigh meat, slippery shiitake mushrooms, slivers of serrano pepper and quarter-sized ginger hunks swimming in a base of fermented bean paste that's been spiced to be less soupy than as thick as a good turkey gravy.\n",
      "The traditional dinner dish comes from the northeastern province of Shandong, more specifically, the capital city of Jinan, where every grandmother has her own way of making the complex, savory braising broth, but not every restaurant serves it.\n",
      "Yang's founder Xiaolu Yang has braised chicken stew in his blood. His family owned several restaurants in Jinan in the 1930s and he learned to make its signature dish from his grandmother, whom he grew up watching prepare it.\n",
      "Xiaolu first tried opening a traditional Shandong-style restaurant in Jinan with a full menu, but soon realized everyone only wanted to order his grandmother's huang men ji. And not only were people ordering the stew, they were getting it with a side of rice that they then mixed in to it, a nontraditional but now-popular way to consume it.\n",
      "The one-dish concept was born.\n",
      "Xiaolu Yang started his one-dish restaurant concept using his grandmother's recipe for huang men ji as the sole offering. (Courtesy of Yang's Braised Chicken Rice)\n",
      "At Yang's, the namesake item of braised chicken stew with a side of rice isn't just a must-order specialty like you'll find at so many regional Chinese restaurants, it's literally the only thing you can order. You just have to decide whether or not you want yours regular, authentic or spicy style — the only difference is the amount of chile peppers tossed in.\n",
      "Since launching the unconventional brand in 2011, Yang's Braised Chicken Rice has opened more than 6,000 locations across Asia and Australia. In most cities in China, this amounts to about two Yang's per neighborhood — a Starbucks-like permeation of quick-service counters all serving just one thing. It's an experiment that embraces efficiency while defying American food trends in customization and personal choice.\n",
      "Tustin is the first Yang's location in the U.S. and it follows the model of minimalism for which this brand is known. Decor amounts to white walls, concrete floors, a counter, some flimsy aluminum chairs at cheap tables and a soda machine. But you don't need anything fancy when the emphasis is on their intoxicating braised chicken stew, which for $9.99 emerges bubbling in a clay pot with a dome of soft white rice in the middle within minutes of being rung up.\n",
      "The first U.S. location of Yang's Braised Chicken Rice opened in Tustin in September 2017. (Photo by Sarah Bennett)\n",
      "Immediately, as you walk the black plastic tray back to your table, the aroma comforts as it affronts, with pangs of ginger and the tickle of spice all coated like a wet drape in a thick brown sauce. Once you sit, let it simmer a bit until the juice curdles up on the sides, then use the spoon to start folding the rice into the sauce.\n",
      "There's no real technique to getting all the rice coated in Yang's famous sauce, but it's a necessary part of the experience and everyone eventually settles on their own method (I stab the rice then scrape down the sides and fold over like I'm mixing brownie batter). If the proportions were properly served, you end up with a thick casserole of bloated rice and vegetables that, either because of or despite its intensity, warms from the inside out.\n",
      "It's the ultimate form of winter sustenance, perfect for those frigid California nights.\n",
      "Yang's Braised Chicken Rice is at 13824 Red Hill Ave., Tustin. For more information, call (714) 731-777 or visit ymyusa.com .\n",

      "President Donald Trump quietly signed a bill into law Tuesday rolling back an Obama-era regulation that made it harder for people with mental illnesses to purchase a gun.\n",
      "The rule, which was finalized in December, added people receiving Social Security checks for mental illnesses and people deemed unfit to handle their own financial affairs to the national background check database.\n",
      "Had the rule fully taken effect, the Obama administration predicted it would have added about 75,000 names to that database.\n",
      "President Barack Obama recommended the now-nullified regulation in a 2013 memo following the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, which left 20 first graders and six others dead. The measure sought to block some people with severe mental health problems from buying guns.\n",
      "The original rule was hotly contested by gun rights advocates who said it infringed on Americans' Second Amendment rights. Gun control advocates, however, praised the rule for curbing the availability of firearms to those who may not use them with the right intentions.\n",

      "As his fellow Republicans offer thoughts and prayers after yet another mass shooting , former Florida congressman David Jolly wants to burn the gun policy impasse to the ground.\n",
      "\"Republicans are not going to do anything on gun control, \" Jolly told The Washington Post on Thursday as the nation reeled from 17 deaths across the peninsula from his former district. \"And history shows that.\"\n",
      "In a phone interview, Jolly excoriated lawmakers in both parties for failing to enact policies he believes can blunt gun violence, which has propelled a never-ending carousel of mass killings in Las Vegas, Orlando and now Parkland, Fla. But he also made a counterintuitive proposal for Democrats: Flank the National Rifle Association's cash-flush lobbying efforts by seeking ties with law-enforcement groups.\n",
      "\"We are a broken nation tonight on the issue of guns, \" Jolly said on CNN Wednesday night hours after the killings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, telling host Don Lemon that the American people are \"begging for leadership\" from lawmakers and the White House as they debate the nation's gun murder problem .\n",
      "[ Graphic: Have your representatives in Congress received donations from the NRA? ]\n",
      "Jolly elaborated in an interview with The Washington Post on Thursday, saying he believes rigidity among both parties has sunk efforts to act on gun policies. \"Democratic leadership have been the loudest voices on gun control but are really unwilling to consider compromise, \" he said.\n",
      "For instance, Jolly sponsored a 2016 bill restricting gun purchases for people on the FBI's terrorist watch list that included a measure for a due-process hearing if purchasers felt they were wrongly denied a firearm. Jolly believed he had bipartisan support, but, he said, Democratic leadership withdrew support because elections were months away and they did not want to help pass legislation drafted by Republicans.

      "J Street has long served dual and sometimes conflicting roles in the central city. It is a major afternoon commuter exit route out of downtown.

During his first speech since his his accusers went public, Trump told a crowd of his supporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in West Palm Beach that he was in fact the victim and one by one called all of the women liars. In a speech that was both painful and at times sickening to listen to, Trump proved exactly why women often avoid reporting assault: the very present fear that they will be publicly shamed — especially when it comes to Trump accusers — for doing so.\n",

      "She watched her son leave for high school, flipped on the flat screen and then, Alecia McNair waited. Most days, her habit was to listen absent-mindedly to \"CBS This Morning\" as she prepared for another day as a 53-year-old single mother. But this past fall, it seemed that every time she turned on the news, there was another story about a man who had abused his power, a woman who had finally spoken up, and — this was the part that McNair could hardly believe — an apology.\n",
      "\"And that was something I feel that I never got, \" she says. She was like so many women, carrying around an experience that she had never really talked about, that she blamed herself for, that she had been determined to leave in the past. But now? It seemed like something was changing. McNair, who asked to be identified by her middle name, no longer worked at the company in Georgia where she says she was harassed. But maybe, she thought, she owed it to the women who were still there to speak up.\n",
      "For the first time, she called an attorney — she made sure to choose a woman — and told her everything. About his comments. His pornographic pictures. His touching.\n",
      "Amanda Farahany listened carefully, taking notes on everything that would indicate McNair's employer had known that the man was predatory, but had done nothing. It sounded as if she might have a case.\n",
      "Then Farahany asked McNair when all this had taken place. In Georgia, the statute of limitations for filing a workplace discrimination claim is 180 days.\n",
      "\"About two years ago, \" McNair answered.\n",
      "Farahany braced herself to say what employment attorneys across the country have found themselves reluctantly repeating more and more since the #MeToo movement began.\n",
      "\"I'm sorry to say that there's probably not anything we can do to help you.\"\n",

      "Last week, babe.net published an anonymous woman's account of her date with actor/comedian Aziz Ansari, who she says pressured her into uncomfortable and unwanted sex, failing to heed her \"verbal and non-verbal cues.\"\n",
      "In response, the internet has produced wave after wave of takes. The Atlantic's Caitlin Flanagan said the article was \"3,000 words of revenge porn\" and unfit for publication. Vox's Anna North characterized Ansari's behavior as common among all-too-many men, and thus worth discussing. The New York Times's Bari Weiss wrote that if Ansari was guilty of anything, it was \"not being a mind reader, \" and fretted that this incident could tarnish the #MeToo movement. Reason's own Elizabeth Nolan Brown thought both parties — as well as men and women in general — could benefit from more communication about sexual desires.\n",
      "These are wildly different takes, and there are dozens more perspectives offered in The Washington Post, National Review, Jezebel, on Twitter, and elsewhere. But most of the takes have one thing in common: they explicitly reject the original article's assertion that Aziz Ansari committed sexual assault. Ansari behaved badly, and there is much to be said about how he ignored his date's wishes, thought only of himself, and expected sexual gratification at every turn. But he is not a rapist, most people seem to agree.\n",
      "And yet, boorish behavior similar to Ansari's — behavior that most pundits say they consider gross but not criminal, at least in Ansari's case — is routinely investigated as sexual misconduct on university campuses. Ansari is lucky he's not a college student; otherwise he could have been accused months or a year after the incident, investigated by a lone administrator with sole power to decide which witnesses to interview, called before a hearing to answer charges he does not fully understand, forbidden from consulting a lawyer or cross-examining his accuser, found responsible for sexual misconduct under a preponderance of the evidenc\n",

      "Former UMass Lowell security officers Timothy McLaughlin and Paulino Carteiro made those allegations, and others, in letters sent to the FBI and media, and in a lawsuit in Middlesex Superior Court, which alleges they were fired in retaliation for speaking out.\n",
      "And a judge recently allowed much of that lawsuit to proceed, after ruling against efforts to have it dismissed.\n",

      "They claim they were ridiculed, subjected to heavy-handed treatment by police, and then fired for trying to bring their allegations to light.\n",
      "The university claims the men were fired for lying and for making threats in a letter that was sent to the FBI.\n",

      "President Trump hasn't succeeded in repealing Obamacare yet. But his administration is doing its best to force the law to fail.\n",
      "The most critical time of the year for the health care law is open enrollment, when millions of people log on to online marketplaces, check whether they qualify for federal subsidies to help them pay their premiums, and shop for plans. For the past three years, at least 10 million people have gotten insurance that way each year.\n",
      "Open enrollment is almost over: It ends Friday, December 15, in most states. So far, sign-ups have been somewhat strong in the face of the Trump administration's overt sabotage. As of December 9, 4.7 million people had signed up for insurance on the federal marketplace.\n",
      "But they still seem likely to fall short of previous years. We can expect about 1.6 million to be automatically enrolled in a new plan at the end of open enrollment, if they haven't actively selected a new one, based on the last two years. It would require an almost-unfathomable surge in the last week for 2018 enrollment on HealthCare.gov to match the 9.2 million in 2017. Something closer to 7.5 million or 8 million is looking more plausible.\n",
      "\"We expect enrollment to grow every year, not to shrink. This market is likely to shrink, \" Caroline Pearson, senior vice president at Avalere, a consulting firm, told me last week. \"It is a big deal, for a market that's already too small and unstable.\"\n",
      "The difference is Trump. This year, open enrollment was in the hands of a White House that's openly hostile to the Affordable Care Act — and the Trump administration took advantage of the best opportunity it had to undercut the law.\n",

      "A 1-year moratorium of the ACA's tax on health insurers\n",
      "Be smart: Conservatives don't love this bill because it doesn't include as much defense spending as they wanted; Democrats largely don't like it because it would only last a month and doesn't include an immigration deal.\n",
      "If this agreement can pass, health care seems like the key to passing it — CHIP to peel off just enough Democrats, especially in the Senate; and delays in ACA taxes to help keep just enough conservatives from jumping ship.\n",
      "Countdown: We're headed for a government shutdown on Friday if Congress can't figure this out. Federal CHIP funding expired at the end of September.\n",
      "Meanwhile, health insurers aren't thrilled about the fact that the bill would freeze their ACA tax for 2019, but not 2018. Lawmakers are apparently concerned that it's too late for consumers to see any benefit from keeping the tax on ice this year.\n",

      "CHIP expired September 30, threatening coverage for millions of recipients who would likely otherwise be uninsured. While the 20-year-old program enjoys wide support from Republicans and Democrats, they have been unable to compromise on an extension over a funding dispute.\n",
      "But last week, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) granted lawmakers a lifeline.\n",
      "In a letter to Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, who heads the Senate's Finance Committee, CBO Director Keith Hall said that a five-year extension of CHIP would cost the government $800 million over a 10-year period. That is $7.4 billion less than the CBO's earlier projection announced in October.\n",
      "\"The new CBO score is great news because a major sticking point has been how to pay for CHIP, \" Tricia Brooks, a healthcare policy expert and former CHIP director for New Hampshire, told Business Insider.\n",
      "Last month, when Congress allocated $2.85 billion in additional funding to keep CHIP running a couple extra months in the most vulnerable states, some lawmakers complained that they didn't have enough money to pay for the program.

      "People who bought their coverage through the Obamacare health exchange were the most likely to say cost drove their decision -- not because they liked the network of doctors or they wanted to maintain the same coverage from the prior year, according to the findings by the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling and the New Jersey Health Care Quality Institute.\n",
      "\"This group is the least satisfied about current costs and thus considers cost most when it comes to choosing a plan, \" said Ashley Koning, assistant research professor and director of the Eagleton Center at Rutgers University-New Brunswick. \"They are the only group to cite this as their top reason and do so by a 3-to-1 margin or more over every other demographic.\"\n",
      "But when all 1,203 people who participated in the poll were asked whether the health care and insurance systems were \"going in the wrong direction\" or were \"on the right track, \" 52 percent responded negatively, 37 positively and 12 percent said they did not know.\n",

Many of us have also heard him speak with great vexation and clarity about the direction of this country and the actions of Donald Trump, particularly on Trump's \"disgusting tenor and tone and all the comments that have been xenophobic, homophobic, racist, misogynistic.\" But I have never heard this man more frustrated, more fed up, and more tense with anger than he was today.

      "Monday marks the public opening of Amazon's first eponymous grocery store: Amazon Go. But unlike the Whole Foods grocery stores Amazon owns, this brick-and-mortar shop in Seattle is supposed to represent the pinnacle of convenience. There are no lines. No checkout counters. Customers are supposed to use a smartphone app and trust the store's network of A.I.-infused sensor and camera systems to complete their purchases. Scan your smart phone app, take something off the shelf, and leave.\n",
      "But the convenience isn't for everyone: The Amazon Go store doesn't accept food stamps, a customer service representative confirmed Monday morning. That's a letdown you wouldn't have seen mentioned in the giddy coverage of the opening, which has explained how the new store works, how Amazon has spent five years perfecting the technology, and how the company did extensive research on how people really hate standing in lines.\n",
      "Elsewhere, Amazon has made a little progress on this score. Last January, it joined six other online grocery retailers in a two-year pilot program accepting Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in three states. And over the summer, the company started offering a steep discount on Prime membership for anyone with a valid Electronic Benefits Transfer card, which transfers money to people on government programs like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and the SNAP food stamps program, cutting the monthly price from $10.99 a month to $5.99 a month. (Last week, Amazon increased the cost of its Prime Membership to $12.99 a month but, according to the company's website, it doesn't appear that increase impacted customers getting the EBT discount.)\n",

      "The fact remains, however, that a number of recent high-profile union drives at blue-collar workplaces that have ended in defeat. It's important to understand the real causes of these failures.\n",
      "Most of these campaigns have taken place in the South, where, as Semuels notes, \"anti-union attitudes are most persistent.\" These attitudes are not inherent to the region, but rather a product of the failure of the labor movement to organize the South, a historical fact rooted in the divisions between white and black workers in the region. These workers were pitted against one another, with the latter used as scab labor to break the former's all-white unions. That division, and unions' failure to address and overcome racism, has now been codified by right-to-work laws. These laws go unmentioned in Semuels's article, but they're central to the divergent outcomes she's analyzing. Right-to-work laws deprive unions of a critical source of funding by prohibiting mandatory dues collection, which makes it that much more difficult to pursue, much less win, organizing campaigns. The Illinois Economic Policy Institute finds that right-to-work laws in the midwest reduce the unionization rate by 2.1 percentage points on average, and lower real hourly wages by 2.6 percent on average. Considering that these laws may go national any day now, this is a reality with which every union must grapple, and every story about organizing must consider.

      "White-collar unionization has an important role to play in helping labor to expand under these difficult conditions. Newly unionized white-collar workers provide dues to increasingly cash-strapped unions, whose funding is under greater attack than ever thanks to the Trump administration. And unionization raises wages sector-wide, both for union and non-union workers. Further, unions in the media sector are capable of drawing a d\n",

      "The company said it planned to work with its labor union to find ways to mitigate the number of employees who lose their jobs, including training for other positions. Heavy-equipment operators will still be needed to work on other equipment.\n",
      "Suncor is the first Canadian oil sands company to introduce autonomous trucks, a technology that has been used in hard rock mines in other parts of the world. It began purchasing them in 2015, but has so far been operating them with drivers.\n",
      "Each mine will have its own control center to manage the 400-tonne vehicles, which have been programmed to operate in conditions unique to the oil sands, Chief Operating Officer Mark Little told Reuters.\n",
      "The trucks, which can run 24 hours a day while only stopping to add fuel, will enhance safety at the company's oil sand mines and reduce operating costs, Little said.\n",

He's building a new house for his family in New York; he owns a Toyota dealership and plans to open another; he has business partnerships with companies like Bank of America, The Hartford, and OrthoLite.\n",
      "And he has advice for current athletes in any sport once they prepare for their \"second life\" after retirement: \"Do the right thing, \" he says. \"And 'the right thing' meaning one thing for sure: you should give back.

And then also, watch what you do with your money because that money will never come back.\"\n",

      "You might think someone who made that much money never has to worry about money again, but sports fans are constantly surprised to see former high-paid stars file for bankruptcy.\n",
      "It happens all the time. In many cases, it's because no one ever helped guide young athletes on how to manage their money — they enter their sport straight out of high school or college and are suddenly earning tens of millions of dollars without knowing where to put it.\n",

      "When his growth stalled at 6-foot-6, however, he knew that he had to expand his skills in order to play in college.\n",
      "\"I've worked on my outside shot a lot over the summer and the spring because I knew that was needed at the next level, \" King said. \"I'll probably be a stretch four (in college). I knew that my size wasn't big enough to play the post like I do now. I was definitely looking ahead.\"\n",
      "As a result of his newfound versatility, King has become even more diverse for the North Stars (13-9, 6-3 Upstate Eight River). He leads the North Stars in scoring (15.1), rebounding (8.7) and assists (3.8), while shooting 54 percent from the field and 36.4 percent from 3-point range.\n",
      "\"If you take something away, Kyle is the type of player who will find it, \" St. Charles North coach Tom Poulin said. \"He doesn't play selfishly. When you play with somebody with a basketball IQ like him, he knows where the basketball needs to go, or if it needs to stay in his hands. He makes good decisions.\"\n",
      "Poulin said that King's move away from being exclusively in the post is utilizing what he thinks is King's best attribute — his passing and court vision.\n",
      "\"He is a gifted facilitator, \" Poulin said. \"I still think his best basketball is ahead of him. He continues to mature physically. He's really developed his perimeter game. He's always been a great passer. As he gets to the college level, they'll have him on the perimeter and his game will just grow.\"\n",
      "After his junior season, King wasn't sure if he was even going to play in college. As the offseason developed with the North Stars and his AAU team, the Tri-City Thunder, interest in him started to grow and he realized it was a possibility.\n",

The ruling requires the Department of Homeland Security to continue accepting renewal applications for Dreamers protected by the Obama-era Deferred Action for Child Arrivals (DACA) program, which President Donald Trump moved to end last year.\n",
      "Tuesday's ruling from New York district court judge Nicholas Garaufis follows a similar preliminary injunction issued last month by California judge William Alsup. As Mother Jones has written, the Trump administration has taken the rare step of appealing Alsup's decision straight to the Supreme Court. But it has not sought not to immediately stop, or \"stay, \" the injunction. As a result, DACA renewals are likely to remain open for months, and possibly through the November midterm elections.\n",

      "Modern American history has never seen as full-scale an effort to sabotage a valid law as we have with President Trump and the Affordable Care Act — a law whose legality has been upheld twice by the US Supreme Court.\n",
      "The president has a legal obligation, under Article II of the US Constitution, to \"take Care that the laws be faithfully executed.\" That means he must make sure that our laws are implemented in good faith and that he uses his executive discretion reasonably toward that end.\n",
      "His agencies likewise have a legal obligation, under the Administrative Procedure Act — the statute that sets the rules for our entire federal regulatory apparatus — not to use their power to engage in arbitrary action.\n",
      "The intentional, multi-pronged sabotage of the ACA that we have seen over the past nine months — reaching new heights since attempts by Congress to repeal the law failed — violates both Trump's constitutional obligations and quite possibly the obligations of his Department of Health and Human Services.\n",
      "Trump does not get to say that he can best help the law by killing it and thereby forcing Congress to start afresh. His obligation is to \"take care\" that the laws that are already on the books are carried out. Since he has flouted this obligation, lawsuits by individuals and states harmed by the damage he causes may now be in order.\n",
      "To be sure, the take care clause is rarely invoked. Indeed, it does not appear ever to have been used successfully in modern times as an offensive tool against a president. Cases are rare because most experts agree that the president must have discretion with respect to how he enforces a law; drawing lines that separate when that discretion is exercised reasonably and, instead, when it changes too much of the law to be \"faithful\" to it (as the clause requires) is extremely difficult.\n",

      "Late Tuesday, the GOP gave up on 2018 budget talks and drafted a new temporary budget plan, dubbed a Continuing Resolution, which would keep the government open for another month until February 16. That date will mark almost five months after the 2018 budget was slated to begin October 1.\n",

Democrats' negotiations tactics include emotional public claims of racism, televised sob stories from migrants, skewed polls, as well as intense back-room lobbying by illegal immigrants, open-borders advocates and by the CEOs whose stock-options would be reduced if a shortage of labor drives up wages.\n",
      "If the amnesty does get approved by an exhausted Trump and GOP, it would wreck Trump's \"Buy American, Hire American\" presidency, 2018 turnout and his reelection. The approval would prove that Democrats, the establishment media, and business lobbies have the political power to simply raise the supply of cheap imported labor whenever companies are forced to pay higher wages to Americans, regardless of Trump's stunning victory in 2016.\n",

      "1. More said avoiding a shutdown is important than continuing DACA\n",

      "The preference for avoiding a shutdown holds across most demographic groups, even those that are traditionally Democratic-leaning. Among young people, it's 50% avoid a shutdown to 42% maintain DACA. Racial and ethnic minorities preferred avoiding a shutdown by 51% to 39%. Women favored keeping the government open by 10 points, 49% to 39%.\n",

      "As we barrel towards a government shutdown, it's becoming clearer and clearer that one of the crucial reasons for the impasse is that we just don't know what President Trump would need in the way of realistic concessions from Democrats that might induce him to agree to a deal protecting the \"dreamers.\"\n",
      "In fact, it's not even clear that the White House or even Trump himself know the answer to this question. And so, if we have a government shutdown, Trump's profound cluelessness about the issues, and the degree to which this renders him susceptible to manipulation by the cynical immigration hard-liners around him, may be key reasons why.\n",
      "I'm told that in a series of meetings between Democratic and GOP leaders and Trump administration officials, Democrats repeatedly pressed their counterparts to make a counter-offer, after Trump rejected the bipartisan deal reached recently that would legalize the dreamers in exchange for some concessions. They have gotten nothing serious in response, I'm told.\n",
      "Frank Sharry, the executive director of America's Voice, told me that senior Democratic aides have been privately briefing him and other immigration advocates on these meetings. They have included Democrats Sen. Richard J. Durbin (Ill.) and Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (Md.), and Republicans Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.) and Rep. Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), the respective Number Twos in their caucuses, and senior White House and Department of Homeland Security officials.\n",
      "Sharry said that Democratic aides detailed for advocates a situation in which the Democrats asked the Republicans and the administration officials to put forward a counter-proposal that would help flesh out what Trump might need to accept a deal. Durbin and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) recently negotiated a bipartisan compromise that would protect the dreamers in exchange for more border security money, tweaks to family-based migration and cuts to visas given out to people from historically lower-immigration countries.\n"

      "At this year's star-studded Jazz at Lincoln Center gala in New York, it was Maye who owned the room. \"There was a real sense that when you came on and performed that they responded like, 'This is the real thing,'\" said Rocca.\n",
      "\"Oh, thank you, \" Maye said. \"Oh, my! Don't cut that out of the interview!\"\n",
      "For Maye, the secret of connecting with an audience comes down to a simple preposition: singing to them, not for them ... a lesson she imparts to her students between gigs. \"It's very important to connect with the audience, \" she instructed.\n",

      "West, the surprise runner-up at the Cook Inlet Conference championships, gets things started at noon with a game against Juneau. Both teams are coming off losses — West fell to South 3-1 in the CIC title game, and Juneau lost to West Valley 3-2 in the Mid-Alaska Conference championship game.\n",
      "West Valley takes on Dimond at 2:30 p.m. Dimond, which went through the CIC's regular season with only two losses, is the conference's No. 4 seed after overtime playoffs losses to West, which beat the Lynx 3-2 in a double-OT semifinal game, and Service, which upset them 4-3 in the third-place game.\n",
      "At 5 p.m., CIC champion South — the runner-up at last year's state tournament — takes on Colony. Both were the top seeds going into their respective conference tournaments, but only South claimed a conference title. Colony's run at a fourth straight North Star Conference title was foiled by Wasilla, which beat the Knights 4-3 in the championship game.\n",
      "Thursday's final first-round game is a showdown between teams that pulled off upsets on their way to state — Service and Wasilla.\n",
      "Service, which finished the regular season as the CIC's fifth-place team with a 6-8 record, knocked off defending state champion Chugiak 8-1 in the first round of the CIC tournament. The Cougars lost their semifinal game against South 4-0 but bounced back in the third-place game, using an overtime goal from Landon Hill — his second goal of the game — to upset Dimond.\n",

      "Natural disastersa\"from hurricanes to mudslides and earthquakesa\"seemed to be on the upswing in 2017, often with devastating effects. Storms in the U.S. alone racked up an estimated $306 billion in damagesa\"the costliest year ever, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Still, these estimates cannot fully account for the economic losses to an affected region, and the impacts can reverberate long after the initial damage, particularly if visitors change travel plans.\n",

      "After the hurricane hit, the Posadas' Puerto Rico Hurricane Relief Fund reached its goal of raising $50,000 in less than 16 hours late last month and have kept going ever since. They're now up to over $340,000.\n",
      "The Posadas also sent numerous planes full of supplies to the devastated island and have helped dozens of sick patients get to the mainland for medical treatment.\n",
      "In addition to gathering donations, part of the Posadas' efforts has included five relief missions to date.\n",
      "PIX11 traveled with the Posadas as they chartered two planes full of supplies, distributed the items door-to-door, then filled those planes with people who needed to get off the island.\n",

      "Marisol Santos and her Achiote Restaurant in Orlando have found a silver lining after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in September and drove thousands of residents to Central Florida.\n",
      "She's finally been able to hire chefs skilled in cooking traditional Puerto Rican cuisine, like mofongo or arroz con gandules.\n",
      "\"I've found a few new chefs, and they really know what they are doing because they have already cooked in restaurants in Puerto Rico, \" Santos said. \"They know the food.\"\n",
      "An estimated 50,000 Puerto Ricans have moved to Central Florida since Hurricane Maria, adding to the 332,000 already here. Restaurant owners and food watchers say the influx could shine a spotlight on Puerto Rican cuisine that has long been underappreciated locally. Already several Puerto Rican restaurant owners have contacted a local small business assistance group, Prospera Florida, about opening new eateries here, said business development consultant Vanessa Rincon. Restaurant owners hope demand will increase with more Puerto Ricans, and business leaders say more variety and quality will showcase some of the island's signature foods.\n",
      "Puerto Rican food brings a blend of flavors from across the Caribbean and Hispanic regions but has distinctions as well. Mofongo is perhaps the island's most distinctive dish, made of mashed plantains, mixed with garlic and pork skins and often stuffed with meats or seafood.\n",
      "According to travel website TripSavvy, arroz con gandules — pigeon peas with rice — is the official dish of the island. It has distinctly Caribbean roots, but the twist to the dish is its secret sauce, known as sofrito.\n",
      "Other traditional favorites, such as marinated pork dishes and rellenos de papa (potato balls stuffed with meat), have the potential to become American staples the same way that Mexican and Chinese food have, Santos said. Or perhaps at least get the exposure of Thai or Vietnamese food, two cuisines that flourish here despite much smaller local populations.\n",

      "It is too early to know how many Americans will ultimately die of this flu this season, but 9.5 percent of all deaths being recorded now are from flu or pneumonia, and a total of 97 children have died thus far.\n",
      "Workers with the St. Louis Red Cross prepare for influenza patients in 1918. This winter's flu season is considered \"moderately severe.\" Credit via Library of Congress, via Associated Press\n",
      "Is this year's flu strain unusually dangerous?\n",
      "H3N2 is the most dangerous of the four seasonal flu strains, but it is not new nor uniquely lethal. A typical season mixes two Type A strains — H1N1 and H3N2, and two Type B strains — Victoria and Yamagata. As of Feb. 17, about 71 percent of all samples genetically sequenced have been H3N2, according to the C.D.C. That strain first emerged in Hong Kong in 1968 and killed an estimated 1 million people around the world that year. B strain flus are now becoming more common; in the last week of testing, more than a third of samples were B's.\n",
      "Are hospitals overwhelmed?\n",
      "Some hospitals in some states, such as Texas , are struggling to keep up with a torrent of flu patients coming in. Local shortages of antiviral medications and flu vaccines have been reported, and patients may have to call several pharmacies to find shots or to fulfill prescriptions.\n",
      "Are large numbers of people dying?\n",
      "Hospitalization rates are leveling off, but the figures presage high death rates. As happens every season, some apparently healthy people have died. They include a 21-year-old fitness buff in Latrobe, Pa. , a mother of three in San Jose, Calif. , and a 10-year-old hockey player in New Canaan, Conn. The latest C.D.C. figures indicate that 97 children and teenagers have died of flu and its consequences, including pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis. In 2014-2015, 148 children died by flu season's end.\n",

      "PUERTO RICO — Yankees legend Jorge Posada and his wife Laura are teaming up to bring much-needed relief to Puerto Rico as the island begins its journey to recovery after being ravaged by Hurricane Maria.\n",
      "After the hurricane hit, the Posadas' Puerto Rico Hurricane Relief Fund reached its goal of raising $50,000 in less than 16 hours late last month and have kept going ever since. They're now up to over $340,000.\n",
      "They've also sent numerous planes full of supplies to the devastated island and have helped dozens of sick patients get to the mainland for medical treatment.\n",
      "When asked if Puerto Rico will ever get back to where it once was, less than a month ago, Jorge Posada replied:\n",
      "\"It's going to take time. It's going to take people to work at it. We need funds to try help a little bit, but it's going to be prettier than ever.\"\n",
      "Here's how you can help the victims of Hurricane Maria\n",
      "Both Posadas have family on the Island, including Laura's father who has struggled to keep his insulin cool as the majority of Puerto Rico is still without power.\n",
      "\"Thank God I was in the position that I was able to help my family, but what about the other people that are sick, and need chemotherapy, or dialysis, or insulin, or whatever. These people need help too, \" she told PIX11.\n",
      "In addition to gathering donations, part of the Posadas' efforts has included five relief missions to date.\n",
      "PIX11 traveled with the Posadas as they chartered two planes full of supplies, distributed the items door-to-door, then filled those planes with people who needed to get off the island.\n",
      "But not everyone who needed to leave were able to. Among them was a desperate mother and her child, who had a feeding tube and needed oxygen.\n",
      "Despite two full planes, the Posadas say they managed to help the baby off the island.\n",
      "\"It is another day. That was a tougher day, because we were desperate, because a kid, you know, obviously he can't talk. He can't express the pain that obviously he was going through.\"\n",

      "It is too early to know how many Americans will ultimately die of this flu this season, but 9.5 percent of all deaths being recorded now are from flu or pneumonia, and a total of 97 children have died thus far.\n",

      "Is this year's flu strain unusually dangerous?\n",
      "H3N2 is the most dangerous of the four seasonal flu strains, but it is not new nor uniquely lethal. A typical season mixes two Type A strains — H1N1 and H3N2, and two Type B strains — Victoria and Yamagata. As of Feb. 17, about 71 percent of all samples genetically sequenced have been H3N2, according to the C.D.C. That strain first emerged in Hong Kong in 1968 and killed an estimated 1 million people around the world that year. B strain flus are now becoming more common; in the last week of testing, more than a third of samples were B's.\n",
      "Are hospitals overwhelmed?\n",
      "Some hospitals in some states, such as Texas , are struggling to keep up with a torrent of flu patients coming in. Local shortages of antiviral medications and flu vaccines have been reported, and patients may have to call several pharmacies to find shots or to fulfill prescriptions.\n",

The latest C.D.C. figures indicate that 97 children and teenagers have died of flu and its consequences, including pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis.

      "Other names that have been announced for the special edition of Raw, which will emanate from both the Manhattan Center and the Barclays Center in New York, include Ric Flair, Triple H, the Dudley Boyz, the Bella Twins, Trish Status and many others. According to WrestlingInc's Justin LaBar, the stacked show will air roughly one hour of footage from the Manhattan Center and two hours from the Barclays Center, and while many legends are expected to appear at the Manhattan Center (the site of Raw's first episode), it's expected that some stars will appear in both locations.\n",
      "The historic event is virtually guaranteed to result in a massive viewership increase for Raw as the show will also serve as the go-home to Royal Rumble episode, which last year attracted nearly 3.3 million viewers without anywhere near the star power that this year's episode boasts. Of course, Raw's 25th anniversary special is more than just a night of excitement and nostalgia and is expected to be pivotal in determining the future direction of many major storylines on the road to WrestleMania 34.\n",
      "While it's widely expected to be a very fun and entertaining episode, it should also give us a clear indication of what we can or cannot expect to see in the coming weeks and months as WrestleMania approaches.

      "Marisol Santos and her Achiote Restaurant in Orlando have found a silver lining after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in September and drove thousands of residents to Central Florida.\n",
      "She's finally been able to hire chefs skilled in cooking traditional Puerto Rican cuisine, like mofongo or arroz con gandules.\n",
      "\"I've found a few new chefs, and they really know what they are doing because they have already cooked in restaurants in Puerto Rico, \" Santos said. \"They know the food.\"\n",
      "An estimated 50,000 Puerto Ricans have moved to Central Florida since Hurricane Maria, adding to the 332,000 already here. Restaurant owners and food watchers say the influx could shine a spotlight on Puerto Rican cuisine that has long been underappreciated locally. Already several Puerto Rican restaurant owners have contacted a local small business assistance group, Prospera Florida, about opening new eateries here, said business development consultant Vanessa Rincon. Restaurant owners hope demand will increase with more Puerto Ricans, and business leaders say more variety and quality will showcase some of the island's signature foods.\n",
      "Puerto Rican food brings a blend of flavors from across the Caribbean and Hispanic regions but has distinctions as well. Mofongo is perhaps the island's most distinctive dish, made of mashed plantains, mixed with garlic and pork skins and often stuffed with meats or seafood.\n",
      "According to travel website TripSavvy, arroz con gandules — pigeon peas with rice — is the official dish of the island. It has distinctly Caribbean roots, but the twist to the dish is its secret sauce, known as sofrito.\n",
      "Other traditional favorites, such as marinated pork dishes and rellenos de papa (potato balls stuffed with meat), have the potential to become American staples the same way that Mexican and Chinese food have, Santos said. Or perhaps at least get the exposure of Thai or Vietnamese food, two cuisines that flourish here despite much smaller local populations.\n",

      "And that number may skyrocket after this year's midterms. Thousands of women have filed to run for offices up and down the ballot, spurring hopes among some that 2018 could become a new \"Year of the Woman.\"\n",

      "Arizona and Vermont have the highest proportion of women serving in state legislatures. In both states, 40 percent of legislators are women. In five other states - Nevada, Colorado, Washington, Illinois and Maine - more than a third of the state legislators are women.\n",

      "CHIP expired September 30, threatening coverage for millions of recipients who would likely otherwise be uninsured. While the 20-year-old program enjoys wide support from Republicans and Democrats, they have been unable to compromise on an extension over a funding dispute.\n",

      "\"The new CBO score is great news because a major sticking point has been how to pay for CHIP, \" Tricia Brooks, a healthcare policy expert and former CHIP director for New Hampshire, told Business Insider.\n",
      "Last month, when Congress allocated $2.85 billion in additional funding to keep CHIP running a couple extra months in the most vulnerable states, some lawmakers complained that they didn't have enough money to pay for the program.

      "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is on track to expand at a 3.3 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 following December data on domestic retail sales and consumer prices, the Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow forecast model showed on Friday.\n",

      "Earlier Friday, the government said the core rate on the Consumer Price Index, which is seen as a proxy on underlying inflation trend, grew 0.3 percent in December, which was its steepest monthly increase in 11 months. This brought its year-over-year gain to 1.8 percent.\n",
      "Federal Reserve policy-makers would like to see core inflation to strengthen to 2 percent.\n",

If chemicals are deemed less risky, they are less likely to be subjected to heavy oversight and restrictions.\n",

The cause was taken up by Dr. Beck and others in the administration of President George W. Bush, with some success, and met with resistance during the Obama administration. Now it has been aggressively revived under President Trump by an array of industry-backed political appointees and others.\n",

      "Other scientists and administrators at the E.P.A., including Wendy Cleland-Hamnett, until last month the agency's top official overseeing pesticides and toxic chemicals, say the dangers are real and the pushback is often a tactic for deflecting accountability — and shoring up industry profits at the expense of public safety.\n",
      "Since Mr. Trump's election, Dr. Beck's approach has been unabashedly ascendant, according to interviews with more than two dozen current and former E.P.A. and White House officials, confidential E.P.A. documents, and materials obtained through open-record requests.\n",

      "A top Department of Health and Human Services official looked into \"reversing\" the abortion of an undocumented teenager in the agency's custody last year, according to a report in Vice. Scott Lloyd, the director of the department's Office of Refugee Resettlement, admitted in a deposition that he had talked to colleagues about the possibility of giving the young woman a shot of progesterone — an unproven means, promoted by anti-choice activists, of halting an in-progress abortion — after she'd taken the first of the two drugs that make up a medical abortion.\n",
      "Lloyd has been the most visible force behind the Trump administration's legal battle to keep unaccompanied, undocumented minors in HHS custody from accessing abortion care. He first drew national attention when a federal judge ordered the administration in October to let an undocumented teenager in a Texas shelter terminate her pregnancy. (Minors in Texas must obtain permission from a parent or judge if they want an abortion; a judge had already signed off on this teen's procedure.) Earlier in the year, Lloyd had directed such federally-funded shelters to stop taking any steps to help minors in their care secure doctor's appointments or transportation related to abortions. He also ordered shelter employees to prevent undocumented abortion-seeking minors from attending their doctor's appointments, and instead take them to \"crisis pregnancy centers\" — offices that appear to be medical facilities where one might get an abortion, but are usually religiously-funded organizations that aim to talk women out of the procedure. Lloyd even called one pregnant teen to try to personally convince her to abandon her plans for an abortion.\n",

      "Mr. Severino said that several federal laws protected the \"conscience rights\" of health care providers, and he reported that complaints of violations had increased significantly since Mr. Trump was elected. From 2008 to October 2016, the civil rights office received 10 complaints, Mr. Severino said, and since the election it has received 34.\n",
      "For too long, Mr. Severino said, the federal government has ignored such complaints or treated them with \"outright hostility.\"\n",

      "Some liberals loathe Pruitt even more than they do Bannon or Trump, given the potential permanence of environmental degradation. Pruitt certainly seems to feel the animosity, even within his agency. Definers Public Affairs, a Republican opposition research firm, was hired to monitor the email accounts of EPA employees critical of him.\n",
      "\"The mood here is morbid, \" says Nate James, an information technology specialist at EPA headquarters in Washington, D.C., as well as the chapter head of American Federation of Government Employees, the union that represents EPA workers. \"There is an element of fear.\"\n",
      "John O'Grady, an engineer in the Chicago regional office of the EPA, says Pruitt \"does not meet with the staff\" and generally behaves like a \"mystery guest\" within the agency. Last summer, Pruitt had his spacious office outfitted with a secure communication booth costing nearly $25,000. This was a practice common among intelligence agency chiefs, not EPA administrators. It suggested grandiosity, ambition and more than a little paranoia. Previous to that, he devoted $9,000 of taxpayer money to the installation of biometric locks and ordered an inspection of his office for listening devices. He travels with a security detail of more than a dozen high-ranking EPA officials who are supposed to be investigating environmental crimes. They are instead guarding Pruitt.\n",
      "All this makes it easy to caricature Pruitt as a zealous anti-environmentalist, even as his associates insist his approach is guided by both principle and faith. Political ambition plainly guides Pruitt as well. In his first three months at the agency, Pruitt spent 43 days in Oklahoma, flying there at taxpayers' expense, but not on taxpayers' business. Instead, his meetings there, with energy concerns and ranchers, looked like the beginnings of a political campaign.

It's not hard to understand why someone like Sessions, with a history of racism, would love the war on drugs: In reality, it was always a war on a very particular set of people — and you can probably guess who those people are. And yet despite Sessions's best efforts, there's been a lot of progress on legalizing marijuana; opinions are changing and, in a lot of places, so are laws.\n",
      "At the intersection of these pushes to legalize weed and the so-called war on drugs, there are a bevy of major scandals unfolding, all of which are ravaging communities of color. And here's the thing about these scandals: They can't simply be blamed on President Donald Trump and his team. Instead, they're deeply rooted in a bipartisan type of anti-blackness.\n",
      "First, the lay of the land: Eight states and Washington, D.C., have now legalized recreational marijuana. Another 14 states have decriminalized recreational marijuana use, meaning you still can't legally buy weed, but if you are caught with very small portions of it, you are supposed to either get a pass or a citation. Twenty-nine states have now legalized varying forms of medical marijuana.\n",

      "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Neptune Financial Inc., or NepFin, a financial services firm, announced today that it has launched the first online commercial lending platform for mid-sized U.S. businesses, creating a new source of credit as well as business software solutions for a large, thriving sector of the economy whose borrowing options are limited.\n",
      "NepFin also announced that it has raised a $10-million Series A round led by Sands Capital Ventures with participation from its existing investors. Michael Raab, Partner at Sands Capital, will join NepFin's board, which already includes Third Point's David Bonanno, currently a board member of SoFi, as well as Robert Schwartz, Managing Partner at Third Point Ventures. This round brings NepFin's total capital raised to $13 million.\n",
      "\"They have developed an innovative way to compete in a lending space that has not changed for decades, \" said Michael Raab of Sands Capital, explaining the firm's investment in NepFin. \"For hundreds of thousands of mid-sized businesses looking to borrow, there aren't many options that provide a smooth, transparent experience. NepFin is now offering something newer, faster and less expensive — and we are very optimistic about its strategy.\"\n",
      "NepFin, whose platform has digital solutions built from the team's years of experience in online lending and traditional finance, says that its focus is on one of the most underserved sectors of the broader U.S. economy — businesses with between $10 million and $100 million in revenue. NepFin provides loans of up to $60 million.\n",
      "\"This market represents such a significant driver of the American economy, but hasn't seen many technological advances in a long time, \" said NepFin CEO and co-founder Albert Periu, previously Global Co-Head of Capital Markets at Funding Circle. \"With commercial banks leaving the market, mid-sized American companies see increasingly few options to fund their growth, and the options currently available to them lack efficiency and\n",

      "(Reuters) - Suncor Energy Inc said on Wednesday that it expected to cut some 400 heavy-equipment operator positions over the next six years as it rolls out a fleet of self-driving trucks at its Canadian oil sand mining operations.\n",

      "The Calgary, Alberta-based company plans to deploy more than 150 driverless trucks and said it would start cutting jobs as soon as next year. It currently has nine autonomous trucks hauling material at its North Steepbank project in Alberta.\n",
      "The company said it planned to work with its labor union to find ways to mitigate the number of employees who lose their jobs, including training for other positions. Heavy-equipment operators will still be needed to work on other equipment.\n",
      "Suncor is the first Canadian oil sands company to introduce autonomous trucks, a technology that has been used in hard rock mines in other parts of the world. It began purchasing them in 2015, but has so far been operating them with drivers.\n",
      "Each mine will have its own control center to manage the 400-tonne vehicles, which have been programmed to operate in conditions unique to the oil sands, Chief Operating Officer Mark Little told Reuters.\n",
      "The trucks, which can run 24 hours a day while only stopping to add fuel, will enhance safety at the company's oil sand mines and reduce operating costs, Little said.\n",
      "He did not provide details on those savings or the cost of the truck fleet.\n",
      "Suncor had 12,837 employees at the end of 2016, including more than 6,000 people in its oil sands business unit.\n"

      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency kept three scientists from speaking at a Monday event in a move condemned by researchers and Democratic members of Congress as an attempt by the agency to silence a discussion of climate change.\n",
      "The scientists were scheduled to discuss a report on the health of Narragansett Bay, New England's largest estuary. Among the findings in the 500-page report is that climate change is affecting air and water temperatures, precipitation, sea level and fish.\n",
      "The EPA didn't explain why the scientists were told not to speak, but said in a statement that the agency supports the program that published the document, the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program, with a $600,000 annual grant. The EPA is the sole funder of the program.\n",
      "\"EPA scientists are attending, they simply are not presenting; it is not an EPA conference, \" agency spokeswoman Nancy Grantham said in a statement Monday.\n",
      "Several people involved in the report and members of the state's congressional delegation likened it to scientific censorship. They cited EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who has rejected the scientific consensus on climate change.\n",
      "During a news conference releasing the report on Monday, John King, a professor of oceanography at the University of Rhode Island and the chair of the science advisory committee for the estuary program, compared the decision to the opening move of a chess game.\n",

      "The first time Ashley McGuire had a baby, she and her husband had to wait 20 weeks to learn its sex. By her third, they found out at 10 weeks with a blood test. Technology has defined her pregnancies, she told me, from the apps that track weekly development to the ultrasounds that show the growing child. \"My generation has grown up under an entirely different world of science and technology than the Roe generation, \" she said. \"We're in a culture that is science-obsessed.\" Activists like McGuire believe it makes perfect sense to be pro-science and pro-life. While she opposes abortion on moral grounds, she believes studies of fetal development, improved medical techniques, and other advances anchor the movement's arguments in scientific fact. \"The pro-life message has been, for the last 40-something years, that the fetus ... is a life, and it is a human life worthy of all the rights the rest of us have, \" she said. \"That's been more of an abstract concept until the last decade or so.\" But, she added, \"when you're seeing a baby sucking its thumb at 18 weeks, smiling, clapping, \" it becomes \"harder to square the idea that that 20-week-old, that unborn baby or fetus, is discardable.\" Related Stories The Progressive Roots of the Pro-Life Movement\n",

      "The Trump administration is fighting the opioid epidemic, President Trump said Tuesday in his first State of the Union address — but the Trump administration hasn't actually done much to fight the epidemic beyond declaring a state of emergency, which is merely a bureaucratic formality.\n",
      "\"In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses: 174 deaths per day. Seven per hour. We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge, \" Trump said in the address. \"My administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need. The struggle will be long and difficult — but, as Americans always do, we will prevail.\"\n",
      "Trump also told the story of a man he invited to the speech, a police officer who, according to Trump, stopped a woman from injecting heroin while on duty in Albuquerque, New Mexico last year. In the story Trump tells, the officer tells a woman she can overcome her addition simply by deciding to overcome it.\n",
      "\"In that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: 'You will do it — because you can,'\" Trump said, asking the officer and his wife to stand.\n",
      "But the opioid epidemic killed 33,000 people in 2015 alone, and it takes a lot more than willpower for people to overcome the the disease. And despite Trump's claims Tuesday night, the Trump administration's fight against the crisis has essentially been confined declaring a state of emergency. They have not declared additional funding to fight the opioid crisis, nor have they heeded the advice of their own Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis.\n",
      "The commission, chaired by former Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, said in July that the best way to fight the opioid crisis would be to increase Medicaid funding.

      "\"Mr. Weyeneth has decided to depart ... at the end of the month, \" the White House said in a statement obtained by the Post. He had previously been reassigned to \"administrative work\" after questions arose about his background.\n",
      "Weyeneth, a 24-year-old former Trump campaign worker, was appointed last year to be the deputy chief of staff at the Office of National Drug Control Policy, or ONDCP, the agency tasked with coordinating federal drug-control efforts. However, as the Post originally reported, Weyeneth had nearly no previous experience after he graduated college in May 2016, aside from working for Donald Trump's presidential campaign and transition.\n",
      "Questions quickly arose about his qualifications after multiple discrepancies popped up on several of his resumes and reports surfaced that another job he held at a New York law firm in 2015 ended after Weyeneth failed to show up for work.\n",
      "He appeared to rise quickly at the ONDCP due to a high level of staff turnover and numerous vacancies at the agency. During the recent government shutdown, the Post noted, Weyeneth was one of three employees at the agency that continued to work after he was listed as essential.\n",
      "News of his departure comes just a week after 10 Democratic senators expressed their displeasure with Weyeneth's appointment. In a letter sent to the White House, the group accused Trump of failing to fill key roles at the ONDCP and the Drug Enforcement Agency and falling behind on promises to tackle the opioid epidemic.\n"

      "Was it only a year ago that Margaret Atwood was the avatar for feminist resistance? That's when the TV adaptation of her \"Handmaid's Tale\" was widely praised for being \"unexpectedly timely\" (and I poked gentle fun at the notion).\n",
      "But oh, how time does fly these days. Suddenly Atwood is defending herself from the charge of being a \"bad feminist\" because she suggested that railroading the accused out of their jobs without any semblance of due process was not, in the end, apt to be a net social improvement.\n",
      "There is something odd happening to feminism these days, a stark split between its older and its younger practitioners. Daphne Merkin hinted at it in her recent New York Times op-ed on women's misgivings about the #MeToo movement. Caitlin Flanagan came right out and said it after the comic actor Aziz Ansari was the subject of a humiliating tell-all about a recent date: \"Sexual mores in the West have changed so rapidly over the past 100 years that by the time you reach 50, intimate accounts of commonplace sexual events of the young seem like science fiction, \" she writes. \"You understand the vocabulary and the sentence structure, but all of the events take place in outer space. You're just too old.\"\n",
      "I have now had dozens of conversations about #MeToo with women my age or older, all of which are some variant on \"What the hey?\" It's not that we're opposed to #MeToo; we are overjoyed to see slime like Harvey Weinstein flushed out of the woodwork, and the studio system. But we see sharp distinctions between Weinstein and guys who press aggressively -- embarrassingly, adulterously -- for sex. To women in their 20s, it seems that distinction is invisible, and the social punishments demanded for the latter are scarcely less than those meted out for forcible rape.\n",
      "There's something else we notice, something that seems deeply connected to these demands for justice: These women express a feeling of overwhelming powerlessness, even though they are not being threatened, either p\n",

      "'Fake news' was the Collins dictionary 'phrase of the year' in 2017, but as Rasmus Nielsen points out early in our discussion, it resists easy definition and has been used by politicians to attack trusted media sources.\n",
      "He doesn't voluntarily mention US President Donald Trump but it's impossible to ignore the recent spectacle of him stage-managing an 'award ceremony' for fake news, which immediately resulted in online coverage with headlines such as 'Are Trump's Fake News Awards Fake?'\n",
      "Apart from the likely confusion over these truth and counter-truth claims, in the minds of the public fake news can mean loads of things from incessant online advertising that tracks their every move, to very low trust in media sources and journalism, and only finally to deliberately fabricated stories on social media.\n",
      "Nielsen, Director of Research for Oxford's Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism and Professor of Political Communication, would like to see some focus now that the term has become 'ubiquitous.'\n",
      "'My personal view is that one should reserve the term, if it is used at all, to the narrowest sense of fake news: information that is false and fabricated, and used either for profit by malicious actors who want to profit from momentary interest, or more perniciously, by state-backed information operations that deliberately try to subvert political processes in other countries by creating confusion, distrust and doubt.'\n",
      "Only in this way, argues Nielsen, can we distinguish it from plain old propaganda and misinformation, which is as old as the hills.\n",
      "'The available evidence suggests so far that the reach of fake news is more limited than is often assumed; the volume of it is more limited than is often assumed, and the most powerful driver of the problem is probably state action — foreign intervention in political processes in different countries.'\n",

      "Philippine media outlet Rappler is facing closure after the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) en banc revoked the company's registration for allegedly violating the country's Constitution.  The watchdog has also accused them of violating the Anti-Dummy Law, the Corporation Code and the Securities Regulation Code.\n",
      "\"The En Banc finds Rappler, Inc. and Rappler Holdings Corporation, a Mass Media Entity and its alter ego, liable for violating the constitutional and statutory Foreign Equity Restriction in Mass Media, enforceable through laws and rules within the mandate of the commission, \" read the decision dated January 11, published on Monday, January 15.\n",
      "The Philippine Constitution says that mass media companies must be fully owned by Filipinos, forbidding any overseas ownership.  The SEC claims that Rappler had violated those rules by taking funds from Omidyar Network, a self-described philanthropic investment firm created by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, a non-Filipino.\n",
      "Rappler argues that the investors provided funding through a Philippine Depository Receipt (PDR) which essentially allow companies to invest in media companies without becoming owners.  Many national companies are said to use PDRs.\n",

      "\"What this means for you, and for us, is that the Commission is ordering us to close shop, to cease telling you stories, to stop speaking truth to power, and to let go of everything that we have built — and created — with you since 2012, \" said the statement.\n",

      "Why it matters : It helps make the economic case for this type of technology, which established science says is essential in cutting greenhouse gas emissions to the level scientists say we must, but is currently too expensive in most instances. It's also seen as key for coal's long-term viability in a world combating climate change.\n",
      "The budget bill Congress passed early Friday morning includes a narrow but important tax incentive that would support technology capturing carbon emissions from coal plants and other facilities.\n",
      "Gritty details: The tax credit, which Congress first created in 2008, is expanded and extended for 12 years in the current budget bill, which experts say would increase the chances of more deployment across a range of innovative but costly technologies in this space. The bill's diverse backers could tout different benefits — climate change or coal's future.\n",
      "The intrigue: As chief sponsor, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota, has been building an unusually broad coalition of support for the measure that began a couple of years ago (and far earlier for broader efforts on carbon capture). The measure's sponsors include Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican from Kentucky, and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat from Rhode Island. Heitkamp also gathered diverse stakeholder support, ranging from environmental groups to coal companies.\n",
      "In short, Heitkamp's efforts represent a bipartisan exception to the partisan rule on one of the most partisan topics: energy and climate change.\n",

      "Editor's note: Breaking views are thoughts from individual members of the editorial board on today's headlines.\n",
      "In an effort to combat the problem of opioid addiction and overdoses, Assemblyman Freddie Rodriguez, D-Pomona, has introduced legislation to restrict the ability of doctors to prescribe opioids for more than 3 days at a time. Under the proposal, patients could refill their prescriptions at a pharmacy up to three times, but on the fourth refill, the doctor would have to explain why additional medication is needed.\n",
      "It's one of those proposals that superficially sounds like it could really help. If one believes that opioids are highly addictive and that more opioids being prescribed means more people will become addicted and that many will end up dying, then it makes sense that cutting down on opioid prescriptions could save lives.\n",
      "As appealing as that line of thinking seems, a look at the relationship between opioid prescriptions and overdose deaths reveals that government efforts to cut the supply of opioids is itself a major driver of the opioid overdose problem in the first place, not a solution.\n",
      "It's a simple, and tragic, example of the unintended consequences of well-intentioned but shortsighted policy making.\n",
      "While nationwide opioid prescriptions declined 18 percent between 2010 and 2015, the rate of overdoses sharply increased from 12.3 per 100,000 population in 2010 to 16.3 in 2015.\n",
      "The decrease in prescriptions was driven by efforts of the Obama administration, the Office of National Drug Control, the Drug Enforcement Administration and several state governments to reduce opioid misuse and perceived over-prescribing through greater enforcement, stricter rules and prosecutions of doctors and pharmacists, according to the Drug Policy Alliance.\n",
      "Rather than saving lives, many who were using prescription opioids turned to to drugs like heroin, which, because of its illegality, is often highly variable in purity and which is often cut with other, more pot\n",

      "Editor's note: Breaking views are thoughts from individual members of the editorial board on today's headlines.\n",
      "In an effort to combat the problem of opioid addiction and overdoses, Assemblyman Freddie Rodriguez, D-Pomona, has introduced legislation to restrict the ability of doctors to prescribe opioids for more than 3 days at a time. Under the proposal, patients could refill their prescriptions at a pharmacy up to three times, but on the fourth refill, the doctor would have to explain why additional medication is needed.\n",
      "It's one of those proposals that superficially sounds like it could really help. If one believes that opioids are highly addictive and that more opioids being prescribed means more people will become addicted and that many will end up dying, then it makes sense that cutting down on opioid prescriptions could save lives.\n",
      "As appealing as that line of thinking seems, a look at the relationship between opioid prescriptions and overdose deaths reveals that government efforts to cut the supply of opioids is itself a major driver of the opioid overdose problem in the first place, not a solution.\n",
      "It's a simple, and tragic, example of the unintended consequences of well-intentioned but shortsighted policy making.\n",
      "While nationwide opioid prescriptions declined 18 percent between 2010 and 2015, the rate of overdoses sharply increased from 12.3 per 100,000 population in 2010 to 16.3 in 2015.\n",
      "The decrease in prescriptions was driven by efforts of the Obama administration, the Office of National Drug Control, the Drug Enforcement Administration and several state governments to reduce opioid misuse and perceived over-prescribing through greater enforcement, stricter rules and prosecutions of doctors and pharmacists, according to the Drug Policy Alliance.\n",
      "Rather than saving lives, many who were using prescription opioids turned to to drugs like heroin, which, because of its illegality, is often highly variable in purity and which is often cut with other, more pot\n",

      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Americans are dying at a rate of 91 per day from opioid overdoses. A principal driver of these deaths is illicitly manufactured fentanyl that is 50 to 100 times more potent than heroin, and carfentanil, which is 1,000 times more potent than heroin.\n",
      "There were 62,000 opioid overdose deaths in 2016; drug overdose deaths have surpassed peak death counts of guns, HIV, and car accidents.

      "BUFFALO, N.Y. — Scientists studying addiction know that heroin and other opioids induce plasticity in brain cells. Now, University at Buffalo researchers have made the novel discovery that in certain types of brain cells, drug-induced plasticity can work to reduce, rather than boost, motivation for heroin.\n",
      "\"Most therapies have focused on the blocking or activating of receptors that bind drugs like heroin, \" explained David Dietz, PhD, senior author of the paper and associate professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB. \"While that approach may be effective in the short-term, it doesn't get to the fundamental problem of what is addiction and how to prevent it, as well as prevent relapse.\"\n",
      "\"Not much is known about glial cells in the context of addiction\" said Dietz, a faculty member with UB's neuroscience program. \"In the addiction field, most neuroscientists focus on neurons. Very rarely have they studied glial cells in psychiatric diseases. This work demonstrates an essential role of glia in addictive behaviors, and offers us the ability to provide a new set of targets for future therapies toward the treatment of addiction.\"\n",
      "Dietz and his colleagues decided to study the potential role of glial cells in addiction when they found that RNA sequencing of tissue from heroin-addicted animals revealed changes in genes that are traditionally markers for a type of glial stem cell called oligodendrocyte precursor cells or OPCs.\n",

      "The following blog post was written after attending the iJOBS Workshop: Strategic Online Networking to Propel Your Career on January 18th, 2018.\n",
      "With this workshop, iJOBS once more offers the opportunity to expand networking skills with the program 2Actify. Following the success of the pilot program launched this past summer, (see Fatu Badiane's experience with 2Actify), the founder, Penny Pearl, is once again demonstrating the importance of effective LinkedIn profiles for career advancement.\n",
      "The goal of the program is to teach you how to meet new people, develop relationships, and to stay in contact with your network. Success with these new skills can not only land you a job, but advance your career. This becomes especially important in today's ever-changing job market, in which less than 1% of online job applicants receive a response. Of those Ph.D. applicants that do, many accept the first position offered, even if the salary is much lower than desired. Still, others are often underemployed. So, as Penny suggests, \"career readiness is a must\".\n",
      "So how can you expect to stand out amidst the multitude of applicants? Simple — through effort, persistence, being strategic about your connections, and staying committed to your goal. Ultimately, you must remember that you are the product, and tools such as your LinkedIn professional profile will advertise your expertise and skills. If done correctly, your profile will serve as the tool for your marketing campaign to attract and reach out to the right connections. The great thing is, the networking process does not need to be as daunting as you might imagine. Often, the best way to start building connections is to take advantage of those you already have! Your professors, your colleagues, alumni, etc. — these are influential people who can form the foundation of your expanding network.\n",

The agents remained at the hospital until she was discharged into their custody, according to Gonzalez. In a statement, the agency said agents \"escorted\" the pair to the hospital.\n",
      "Rosa Maria is now in a shelter run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which falls under the Department of Health and Human Services, as is customary with undocumented, unaccompanied minors. The child remains without her parents, and it's unclear when she'll be released or what will happen to her, according to Gonzalez.\n",

      "On August 14, 2013, nearly 700 civilians were brutally killed by Egyptian security forces in Cairo's Rabaa Al-Adawiya Square, when supporters of ousted President Mohammad Morsi, who gathered for a peaceful demonstration, were shot to death on the orders of Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Thereafter, Egyptian activists adopted a four-finger salute as a protest sign. Flyers, posters and stickers depicting the symbol have spread throughout Egypt as a gesture of solidarity to those who lost their lives during the brutal crackdown. Now, weeks before to so-called \"elections\" in Egypt, al-Sisi's government has taken further steps to crush free speech in the country by banning the four-fingered symbol. According to a law drafted last week in parliament, any Egyptian citizen carrying, distributing or posting printed materials displaying the sign could be fined or even jailed. Absurdly, the very emblem that came to represent opposition to government tyranny has now been outlawed by an illegitimate Egyptian regime. This comes just days after al-Sisi's main political rivals were arrested or intimidated into dropping out of the upcoming race, thereby leaving the 63-year-old president — who has served in office for over three years — to compete against himself. What a sad testament to the current state of human rights in Egypt, which just seven years ago had millions of protesters in the streets calling for liberty and dignity. The only difference between Mubarak and al-Sisi is their names. Other than that, both men have ensured that their country remains unsafe, undemocratic and, most unfortunately, unfree. — Fare abu Hilal\n",

      "Earlier Friday, the government said the core rate on the Consumer Price Index, which is seen as a proxy on underlying inflation trend, grew 0.3 percent in December, which was its steepest monthly increase in 11 months. This brought its year-over-year gain to 1.8 percent.\n",

Like the Flint residents who fought the lead poisoning of their water supply, the working-class residents of eastern Kentucky are confronting the hostile indifference of the authorities.\n",
      "Gary Michael Hunt, a 38-year-old former coal miner, was choked and handcuffed by a state trooper during an emergency public meeting last week because he criticized the inaction of officials. The incident, captured on video and viewed hundreds of thousands of times, evoked popular revulsion towards county officials and statements of solidarity with Hunt.\n",
      "On Thursday, the water tower in Martin County was leaking so badly that treated water was spraying on the ground, creating a slab of frozen water, 10 feet long by 6 feet wide. Some residents estimate that the storage container has been leaking for at least two weeks. To add insult to injury, county authorities want to raise rates by 49.5 percent for water, which the authorities admit is laden with dangerous chemicals stemming from the breaking of a coal slurry dam two decades ago.\n",

      "Yasinow was in the midst of her first elected term on council, when it needed to fill a vacated seat. She said although Ungar, who had been chair of the city's planning commission for nearly 20 years, wasn't her first choice, he ended up getting the seat and she was OK with it.\n",
      "\"I'm very happy I didn't get my way on the first go around, \" said Yasinow, a member of Anshe Chesed Fairmount Temple in Beachwood. \"One thing that became obvious with Mike is he brings a very, frankly, open but serious mind to all of the issues facing Cleveland Heights. And fairness — I find him to be temperamentally excellent in the role.\"\n",

      "Moreover, running together presented an opportunity to flip the traditional mentor-mentee relationship: Yasinow, 33, a sixth-year associate at Kohrman Jackson & Krantz in Cleveland, mentored Ungar, 58, partner and chair of litigation at Ulmer & Berne in Cleveland, on how to run a political campaign.\n",

      "The new report has raised alarm among scientists and prompted calls for nations to consider more drastic emissions reductions at the upcoming climate negotiations in Bonn.\n",
      "\"Globally averaged concentrations of CO2 reached 403.3 parts per million (ppm) in 2016, up from 400.00 ppm in 2015 because of a combination of human activities and a strong El Nino event, \" according to The Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, the UN weather agency's annual flagship report.\n",
      "This acceleration occurred despite a slowdown — and perhaps even a plateauing — of emissions because El Nino intensified droughts and weakened the ability of vegetation to absorb carbon dioxide. As the planet warms, El Ninos are expected to become more frequent.\n",
      "The increase of 3.3 ppm is considerably higher than both the 2.3 ppm rise of the previous 12 months and the average annual increase over the past decade of 2.08ppm. It is also well above the previous big El Nino year of 1998, when the rise was 2.7 ppm.\n",
      "The study, which uses monitoring ships, aircraft and stations on the land to track emissions trends since 1750, said carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is now increasing 100 times faster than at the end of the last ice age due to population growth, intensive agriculture, deforestation and industrialisation.\n",
      "The last time Earth experienced similar CO2 concentration rates was during the Pliocene era (three to five million years ago), when the sea level was up to 20m higher than now.\n",

      "In an effort to combat the problem of opioid addiction and overdoses, Assemblyman Freddie Rodriguez, D-Pomona, has introduced legislation to restrict the ability of doctors to prescribe opioids for more than 3 days at a time. Under the proposal, patients could refill their prescriptions at a pharmacy up to three times, but on the fourth refill, the doctor would have to explain why additional medication is needed.\n",
      "It's one of those proposals that superficially sounds like it could really help. If one believes that opioids are highly addictive and that more opioids being prescribed means more people will become addicted and that many will end up dying, then it makes sense that cutting down on opioid prescriptions could save lives.\n",
      "As appealing as that line of thinking seems, a look at the relationship between opioid prescriptions and overdose deaths reveals that government efforts to cut the supply of opioids is itself a major driver of the opioid overdose problem in the first place, not a solution.\n",

      "BUFFALO, N.Y. — Scientists studying addiction know that heroin and other opioids induce plasticity in brain cells. Now, University at Buffalo researchers have made the novel discovery that in certain types of brain cells, drug-induced plasticity can work to reduce, rather than boost, motivation for heroin.\n",
      "\"Most therapies have focused on the blocking or activating of receptors that bind drugs like heroin, \" explained David Dietz, PhD, senior author of the paper and associate professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB. \"While that approach may be effective in the short-term, it doesn't get to the fundamental problem of what is addiction and how to prevent it, as well as prevent relapse.\"\n",
      "\"Not much is known about glial cells in the context of addiction\" said Dietz, a faculty member with UB's neuroscience program. \"In the addiction field, most neuroscientists focus on neurons. Very rarely have they studied glial cells in psychiatric diseases. This work demonstrates an essential role of glia in addictive behaviors, and offers us the ability to provide a new set of targets for future therapies toward the treatment of addiction.\"\n",
      "Dietz and his colleagues decided to study the potential role of glial cells in addiction when they found that RNA sequencing of tissue from heroin-addicted animals revealed changes in genes that are traditionally markers for a type of glial stem cell called oligodendrocyte precursor cells or OPCs.\n",

      "So the former high school English teacher turned curriculum director for 115 Chicago schools created ThinkCERCA, a digital program that forces students to think critically, work collaboratively, and remain constantly engaged with the content in order to produce argumentative writing. No matter the subject.\n",
      "\"Thinking critically and expressing a point of view effectively is hard work, \" Murphy says. \"But in the information age, the age of robots, that is what is going to have currency in the marketplace.\"\n",
      "Take math. ThinkCERCA starts by asking a question, such as: \"How can the government stop diseases from becoming pandemics?\" Students select one of 10 reading levels, each with its own examples — the third-grade level might look at how the common cold spreads, while students doing eighth-grade work might learn about Ebola in West Africa. All readings are filled with instructions in mathematical modeling and data to back up the students' arguments.\n",
      "Next, students move through the research phase by reading and gathering data, and then they draft their CERCA: Claim, Evidence, Reasoning, Counterargument, Audience. The program offers tips and sentence stems to help get the ideas flowing. By the end, after a process that also includes collaboration with peers, students submit their written argument online, allowing teachers to provide feedback and keep all lessons in a centralized location.\n",

You may not necessarily agree with how someone is protesting, but as long as it's peaceful ... Now, saying that, would I kneel during the anthem? No. I don't think I would kneel during the anthem. But everyone has their own personal choice. I think people have lost sight of the fact of what someone is protesting about, and they are focusing on how they're protesting, which is unfortunate.

      "A 477-page report released on Friday said it was \"extremely likely\" — meaning with 95 to 100% certainty — that global warming is manmade, mostly from carbon dioxide through the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.\n",
      "The energy secretary, Rick Perry, and Environmental Protection Agency chief, Scott Pruitt, have said carbon dioxide is not the primary contributor to global warming.\n",
      "Despite fears by some scientists and environmental advocates, David Fahey of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) and several authors said there was no political interference or censoring.

      "\"In the addiction field, most neuroscientists focus on neurons. Very rarely have they studied glial cells in psychiatric diseases.\"\n",
      "BUFFALO, N.Y. — Scientists studying addiction know that heroin and other opioids induce plasticity in brain cells. Now, University at Buffalo researchers have made the novel discovery that in certain types of brain cells, drug-induced plasticity can work to reduce, rather than boost, motivation for heroin.\n",
      "\"Most therapies have focused on the blocking or activating of receptors that bind drugs like heroin, \" explained David Dietz, PhD, senior author of the paper and associate professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB. \"While that approach may be effective in the short-term, it doesn't get to the fundamental problem of what is addiction and how to prevent it, as well as prevent relapse.\"\n",
      "\"Not much is known about glial cells in the context of addiction\" said Dietz, a faculty member with UB's neuroscience program. \"In the addiction field, most neuroscientists focus on neurons. Very rarely have they studied glial cells in psychiatric diseases. This work demonstrates an essential role of glia in addictive behaviors, and offers us the ability to provide a new set of targets for future therapies toward the treatment of addiction.\"\n",
      "Dietz and his colleagues decided to study the potential role of glial cells in addiction when they found that RNA sequencing of tissue from heroin-addicted animals revealed changes in genes that are traditionally markers for a type of glial stem cell called oligodendrocyte precursor cells or OPCs.\n",

      "Editor's note: Breaking views are thoughts from individual members of the editorial board on today's headlines.\n",
      "In an effort to combat the problem of opioid addiction and overdoses, Assemblyman Freddie Rodriguez, D-Pomona, has introduced legislation to restrict the ability of doctors to prescribe opioids for more than 3 days at a time. Under the proposal, patients could refill their prescriptions at a pharmacy up to three times, but on the fourth refill, the doctor would have to explain why additional medication is needed.\n",
      "It's one of those proposals that superficially sounds like it could really help. If one believes that opioids are highly addictive and that more opioids being prescribed means more people will become addicted and that many will end up dying, then it makes sense that cutting down on opioid prescriptions could save lives.\n",
      "As appealing as that line of thinking seems, a look at the relationship between opioid prescriptions and overdose deaths reveals that government efforts to cut the supply of opioids is itself a major driver of the opioid overdose problem in the first place, not a solution.\n",
      "It's a simple, and tragic, example of the unintended consequences of well-intentioned but shortsighted policy making.\n",
      "While nationwide opioid prescriptions declined 18 percent between 2010 and 2015, the rate of overdoses sharply increased from 12.3 per 100,000 population in 2010 to 16.3 in 2015.\n",
      "The decrease in prescriptions was driven by efforts of the Obama administration, the Office of National Drug Control, the Drug Enforcement Administration and several state governments to reduce opioid misuse and perceived over-prescribing through greater enforcement, stricter rules and prosecutions of doctors and pharmacists, according to the Drug Policy Alliance.\n",
      "Rather than saving lives, many who were using prescription opioids turned to to drugs like heroin, which, because of its illegality, is often highly variable in purity and which is often cut with other, more pot\n"

      "Despite their name, ice giants are actually hot as heck. Sure, temperatures in the upper atmosphere hover hundreds of degrees Fahrenheit below zero, thanks to the planets' distance from the sun. But as you approach the core, the immense pressure crushing the interior heats things up thousands of degrees. These balmy temps and crushing pressures could theoretically prime hydrogen and carbon to form diamond rain some 5,000 miles below the outer surface of the atmosphere.\n",
      "\"Previously, researchers could only assume that the diamonds had formed, \" Dominik Kraus, scientist at Helmholtz Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf and lead author of a study on the results, said in a statement . \"When I saw the results of this latest experiment, it was one of the best moments of my scientific career.\"\n",
      "When subjected to the pressures (and temperatures) of life on other planets, even familiar substances can get pretty alien. Case in point: the diamond rains of the ice giants. Scientists have long thought that massive planets like Neptune and Uranus — which contain relatively tiny rocky cores covered with a mantle of slurried water, ammonia, and methane ices and surrounded by a thick atmosphere — are subject to rain made of literal diamonds. Now researchers have synthesized the process in a lab, showing how such conditions might occur.\n",
      "To replicate the process, scientists had to make some (very) hot and (very) heavy conditions. They used an intense laser to send a pair of overlapping shockwaves through polystryene — a plastic, made from hydrogen and carbon, that can simulate the behavior of methane compounds. The shockwaves created a brief moment of pressure and heat comparable to everyday life in an ice giant's interior.\n",
      "\"The experimental time is very short, \" Kraus told The Guardian. \"That we saw this very clear signature of diamonds was actually very, very surprising.\"\n",

      "Republicans, Democrats and a coalition of redistricting-reform advocates reached a deal to put a proposal on the May ballot aimed at curtailing partisan gerrymandering of Ohio's congressional map.\n",
      "After weekend negotiations that capped off about two weeks of heavy talks, the Senate on Monday night voted 31-0 for the compromise plan. The House is likely to approve it Tuesday, one day ahead of the Feb. 7 deadline to qualify the issue for the May statewide ballot.\n",
      "The current redistricting process requires no minority-party support and has almost no rules, other than requirements regarding district population and prohibiting conflict with the federal Voting Rights Act. The new proposal would initially require 50 percent of the minority party in each chamber to approve a map for 10 years. It also would limit how often counties can be split into multiple congressional seats, and it would require public hearings and the ability for the public to submit maps.\n",
      "Under that plan, 65 counties cannot be divided, 18 can be divided once and five can be divided twice into three congressional districts. Currently, many counties are split, while Cuyahoga and Summit counties in Democrat-rich northeast Ohio are split into four districts as Republicans sliced them up for partisan advantage.\n",
      "\"Far fewer counties can be divided under this map, \" said Sen. Matt Huffman, R-Lima, a leader in crafting the plan.\n",
      "If the legislature is unable to come to a bipartisan agreement, the process would be handed to a seven-member commission consisting of the governor, auditor, secretary of state and four lawmakers, where a 10-year map would require at least two minority-party votes.\n",

      "Judge William J. Martinez's order stops short of striking the amendment down but pledges to block a significant part of it from being enacted unless Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams can convince him otherwise.\n",
      "If the judge follows through with an injunction, it could have significant consequences for the 2018 ballot. Some advocacy groups that are considering pursuing statutory ballot initiatives may change course and pursue constitutional measures. Meanwhile, those that are seeking constitutional changes would face a much easier path.\n",
      "Amendment 71, dubbed \"Raise the Bar\" by supporters, lifts the threshold for passage of constitutional amendments to 55 percent of the vote. And, to get on the ballot, measures now need signatures from 2 percent of registered voters in all 35 state Senate districts.\n",
      "Backers said the changes were long overdue, arguing that Colorado's ballot access laws make it too easy to change the state constitution — which ranks among the longest and most convoluted in the country. And, they said, the Senate district requirement is needed to give rural Colorado more say in what goes on the ballot. Previously, signature gathering efforts have typically been concentrated within the major population centers of the Front Range.\n",
      "Voters adopted it by a wide margin. But in April, opponents of the measure filed suit, arguing that the signature requirement violates the principle of \"one person, one vote, \" because Colorado's Senate districts vary greatly in their voting populations.

      "On May 28, 1988, Lisa Carl went to her local movie theater, something millions of Americans can do with ease and comfort. Yet when Lisa tried to go into the theater, the manager refused her ticket, denying her entry because Lisa had cerebral palsy and used a wheelchair. When an advocate called the theater owner about the incident, the manager coldly stated, \"I don't want her in here, and I don't have to let her in.\"\n",
      "Lisa later testified before Congress, \"I was not crying on the outside, but I was crying on the inside. I just wanted to watch the movie like everyone else.\" While the cruelty is heartbreaking, the true outrage was that in 1988, the law actually sided with the theater owner, who was free to legally discriminate against Lisa and deny her access to a public theater because she was born with a disability.\n",
      "Fortunately, millions of Americans with disabilities and their families refused to accept this discrimination. They shared their stories and pushed and prodded a bipartisan coalition of legislators to end decades of legally sanctioned discrimination through passage of the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990.\n",

But the stark fact remained that people with disabilities were still victims of segregation and discrimination, and this was intolerable.\" Bush declared, \"Let the shameful wall of exclusion finally come tumbling down.\"\n",

      "Recent observations and investment in modeling and research have only strengthened the quality and amount of evidence collected. As the report documents, each of the last three years has successively been the warmest on record based on observational data going back to the late 19th century, and 16 of the last 17 years have been among the 17 warmest years on record globally. Global sea level has risen by about 7 to 8 inches since 1900, with nearly half this rise occurring since 1993. A substantial component of this rise, which is accelerating the increased frequency of disruptive \"nuisance\" flooding in dozens of coastal American cities, is because of human activity. At the same time, the area of ocean covered by Arctic sea ice in September (the typical annual minimum) has decreased by about 50 percent, while its volume has decreased even more dramatically as the remaining ice thins.\n",
      "The report also highlights growing reasons for concern. For example, ocean acidification, which occurs when atmospheric carbon dioxide is absorbed by seawater, is taking place at what is thought to be the fastest rate in at least 66 million years. Coupled with reductions in oxygen content in near-coastal American waters, this poses a significant threat to coastal fisheries and ecosystems. Much of the western United States is facing a growing threat of more severe drought and larger wildfires as higher temperatures, reduced snow pack and earlier spring snow melt reduce water avai\n",

      "In an effort to combat the problem of opioid addiction and overdoses, Assemblyman Freddie Rodriguez, D-Pomona, has introduced legislation to restrict the ability of doctors to prescribe opioids for more than 3 days at a time. Under the proposal, patients could refill their prescriptions at a pharmacy up to three times, but on the fourth refill, the doctor would have to explain why additional medication is needed.\n",
      "It's one of those proposals that superficially sounds like it could really help. If one believes that opioids are highly addictive and that more opioids being prescribed means more people will become addicted and that many will end up dying, then it makes sense that cutting down on opioid prescriptions could save lives.\n",
      "As appealing as that line of thinking seems, a look at the relationship between opioid prescriptions and overdose deaths reveals that government efforts to cut the supply of opioids is itself a major driver of the opioid overdose problem in the first place, not a solution.\n",
      "It's a simple, and tragic, example of the unintended consequences of well-intentioned but shortsighted policy making.\n",
      "While nationwide opioid prescriptions declined 18 percent between 2010 and 2015, the rate of overdoses sharply increased from 12.3 per 100,000 population in 2010 to 16.3 in 2015.\n",
      "The decrease in prescriptions was driven by efforts of the Obama administration, the Office of National Drug Control, the Drug Enforcement Administration and several state governments to reduce opioid misuse and perceived over-prescribing through greater enforcement, stricter rules and prosecutions of doctors and pharmacists, according to the Drug Policy Alliance.\n",
      "Rather than saving lives, many who were using prescription opioids turned to to drugs like heroin, which, because of its illegality, is often highly variable in purity and which is often cut with other, more pot\n"

      "BUFFALO, N.Y. — Scientists studying addiction know that heroin and other opioids induce plasticity in brain cells. Now, University at Buffalo researchers have made the novel discovery that in certain types of brain cells, drug-induced plasticity can work to reduce, rather than boost, motivation for heroin.\n",
      "\"Most therapies have focused on the blocking or activating of receptors that bind drugs like heroin, \" explained David Dietz, PhD, senior author of the paper and associate professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB. \"While that approach may be effective in the short-term, it doesn't get to the fundamental problem of what is addiction and how to prevent it, as well as prevent relapse.\"\n",

This work demonstrates an essential role of glia in addictive behaviors, and offers us the ability to provide a new set of targets for future therapies toward the treatment of addiction.\"\n",

Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), cast an ominous backdrop to the event by calling on authorities to perform identification checks and round up any undocumented immigrants attempting to attend the speech. Gosar's office said that the congressman had been in contact with Capitol Police and the Justice Department about his proposal:\n",

      "Additionally, Congressman Gosar asked that they arrest those using fraudulent social security numbers and identification to pass through security. — Rep. Paul Gosar, DDS (@RepGosar) January 30, 2018\n",

Beyond these tragedies, which understandably seize the public's attention, are dozens more in cities around America — nearly one per day .\n",

      "The thing about the movement formerly known as the alt right — a far-right subculture whose anarchic ideology is inseparable from the Internet — is that its inhabitants are, by and large, painfully, haltingly awkward. They could be neo-Nazis, gleeful that Donald Trump disparages immigrants and minorities; they could be Internet trolls who while away their evenings making anti-Semitic Pepe the Frog memes in MS Paint. They could spend their time angrily fighting with Black Lives Matter on Twitter or flooding a woman's DMs with rape threats that they've rebranded as jokes (irony, after all, is a useful tool in the proto-fascist playbook). But for the most part, they're computer-dependent outcasts who find social satisfaction in watching far-right celebrities rant on the Internet.

      "In the fall of 2016, Harvey Weinstein set out to suppress allegations that he had sexually harassed or assaulted numerous women. He began to hire private security agencies to collect information on the women and the journalists trying to expose the allegations. According to dozens of pages of documents, and seven people directly involved in the effort, the firms that Weinstein hired included Kroll, which is one of the world's largest corporate-intelligence companies, and Black Cube, an enterprise run largely by former officers of Mossad and other Israeli intelligence agencies. Black Cube, which has branches in Tel Aviv, London, and Paris, offers its clients the skills of operatives \"highly experienced and trained in Israel's elite military and governmental intelligence units, \" according to its literature. Two private investigators from Black Cube, using false identities, met with the actress Rose McGowan, who eventually publicly accused Weinstein of rape, to extract information from her. One of the investigators pretended to be a women's-rights advocate and secretly recorded at least four meetings with McGowan. The same operative, using a different false identity and implying that she had an allegation against Weinstein, met twice with a journalist to find out which women were talking to the press. In other cases, journalists directed by Weinstein or the private investigators interviewed women and reported back the details. The explicit goal of the investigations, laid out in one contract with Black Cube, signed in July, was to stop the publication of the abuse allegations against Weinstein that eventually emerged in the New York Times and The New Yorker. Over the course of a year, Weinstein had the agencies \"target, \" or collect information on, dozens of individuals, and compile psychological profiles that sometimes focussed on their personal or sexual histories.

While this is the only allegation of such conduct, Mr. Quinn also recently pled guilty to misdemeanor disorderly conduct.

      "'LA Times' Business Editor Returns After Internal Leak Inquiry\n",

      "The business editor of the Los Angeles Times made a triumphant return to the newsroom to applause Thursday after several days away, telling colleagues she had been whisked away and suspended as part of the newspaper's investigation into the leak of taped remarks made by the paper's editor-in-chief in November.\n",
      "According to several staffers, Business Editor Kimi Yoshino told members of the LA Times business desk that the then editor-in-chief, Lewis D'Vorkin, personally walked her to human resources offices last week. Yoshino said she was then grilled over a conversation she had with New York Times reporter Sydney Ember in advance of a story published in that paper.\n",
      "That story revealed that reporters clashed with D'Vorkin at a November newsroom meeting over his handling of the Walt Disney Co.'s condemnations of the LA Times for its coverage of financial breaks given by the City of Anaheim to the entertainment giant. D'Vorkin had not publicly defended the LA Times' reporting even as Disney blocked LA Times reporters and critics from advance screenings of its films, inhibiting cultural coverage and movie reviews. The company lifted the ban after a meeting with D'Vorkin and LA Times Publisher Ross Levinsohn.\n",
      "Yoshino denied sharing any audio with the New York Times reporter, telling colleagues she simply had an innocuous conversation with Ember shortly before the story.\n",
      "The leak of the staff meeting and the subsequent story in the rival New York Times incensed D'Vorkin and LA Times Publisher Ross Levinsohn, who called New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet to complain, according to a spokeswoman for the New York paper. (Levinsohn did not respond to requests for comment.)\n",
      "In a second staff meeting in November, called in response to the New York Times piece, D'Vorkin said the leaks of the audio to Ember were \"unethical, \" ad\n",

      "Fire crews battled the flames — and subzero conditions — at 1713 Hegberg Road, in Duluth Township about 20 miles northeast of the city of Duluth. Thick smoke billowed across the road and could be seen from several miles away.\n",
      "The St. Louis County Sheriff's Office reported that the fire was quickly contained after it began at 10 a.m. Sunday, but the structure was considered a total loss. The home was valued at $300,000. No one was home at the time of the fire, but two dogs were inside the home, according to the Sheriff's Office. The cause of the fire is under investigation.\n",
      "Fire crews from Clifton, Normanna, Two Harbors, Lakewood, Rice Lake, Gnesen, Fredenberg, the 148th Fighter Wing and Canosia responded to the fire, as well as St. Louis County Public Works plow crews and Two Harbors Ambulance.\n",

      "U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona agrees with President Donald Trump on one thing: The state of the union is strong. But Gallego says it is in spite of the president, not because of him.\n",
      "In a characteristically sharp rebuke to the president's own annual assessment, the Arizona Democrat said Trump is a \"bad dealmaker\" whose policy flip-flops keep Congress from getting more done.\n",
      "\"The state of the union is strong, and it's not because of this president or any other past president, \" Gallego said in an interview with The Arizona Republic. \"The state of the union is always strong because our strength is found in everyday people going to work, raising their kids, trying to live the American dream.\n",
      "\"The question is as president, can you make it stronger? Can you make it better? Can you lay out the vision to do that? I don't think he knows how to do that, and I don't think he is presidential enough to do that.\"\n",
      "Gallego urged Trump to work more closely with Democrats if he's serious about passing legislation.\n",
      "\"The most important thing is that the president is realistic about how to pass legislation, considering the reality that his caucus is divided, is to work with us, \" Gallego said. \"There's a way for us to do that to pass the Dream Act, bring more border security, increase funding for our military and actually have a true infrastructure bill. ... The outcomes are better if he understands the reality that the Republican caucus can't govern.\"\n",
      "Gallego said Trump has seemingly sketched out positions on immigration and border security that could have served as the template for legislative deals, only to reject his own positions after consulting with his staff.\n",
      "\"He's all over the place, \" Gallego said. \"Anything he says right now about what he wants to do in the State of the Union, the problem is he's not going to be able to execute, especially anything that requires legislative approval.\"\n",

Since the start of the new year, 18 states and 19 cities have seen an increase in minimum wages, according to the National Employment Law Project, with an additional three states and 18 cities and counties poised to make increases later this year. These efforts to uplift people out of poverty are essential: the official poverty rate in the United States in 2016 (the latest year we have statistics for) was 12.7%. For children under the age of 18, the official rate was 18%. While these are slight decreases (of about 1%) from the preceding year, this still translates into over 40 million people living in poverty.\n",
      "One in seven Americans are hungry — not because there isn't enough food, but because they don't have the money to buy it. Ironically, these numbers include a disproportionate number of people working in the food industry. This is detailed in my book, as well as in the recent report from the Food Chain Workers Alliance and Solidarity Research Cooperative, titled \"No Piece of the Pie: U.S. Food Workers in 2016, \" that stated:\n",
      "Despite employment growth, the food chain pays the lowest hourly median wage to frontline workers compared to workers in all other industries. The annual median wage for food chain workers is $16,000 and the hourly median wage is $10, well below the median wages across all industries of $36,468 and $17.53.\n",
      "Food chain workers rely on public assistance and are more food insecure than other workers. Thirteen percent of all food workers, nearly 2.8 million workers, relied on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits (food stamps) to feed their household in 2016. This was 2.2 times the rate of all other industries, a much higher rate than in 2010 when food workers had to use food stamps at 1.8 times the rate of all other industries.\n",

      "The Missouri tennis team has gotten off to a blistering-hot start to the 2018 season, posting a 5-0 record over five matches since the team restarted play on Jan. 20 after an almost three-month hiatus. The Tigers had last competed on Oct. 22 at the ITA Central Regional in Lawrence, Kansas.\n",
      "Missouri's return to competition started on Jan. 20, when the team posted 5-0 and 6-1 victories over the Southeast Missouri State Redhawks and the Central Arkansas Bears, respectively, at the Mizzou Tennis Complex.\n",
      "Against the Redhawks, senior Amina Ismail, sophomore Mackenzy Middlebrooks and freshman Ellie Wright all went 2-0 to pace the Tigers. Ismail and freshman Taylor Gruber teamed up for a 6-2 victory in their doubles match, while the partnership of Middlebrooks and Wright combined for a 6-1 victory. The wins gave Missouri the doubles point in the match. Middlebrooks, Wright and Ismail all won convincingly in their singles matches, as none of the women lost more than three games against their Redbirds opponents.\n",
      "Ismail, Middlebrooks and Wright were the stars against the Bears as well. All three won both their doubles and singles matches.\n",
      "Missouri carried its success from Jan. 20 into the team's road trip to Ithaca, New York, from Jan. 26-28. The team once again picked up the doubles point against the Cornell Big Red on Jan. 26, winning two of the team's three doubles matches. While Missouri had more trouble in the singles matches against the Big Red than against the Redhawks or the Bears, wins from Wright, Middlebrooks and Gruber were enough to put Missouri over the top and clinch a 4-2 match victory.\n",

      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers criticizing Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into U.S. President Donald Trump's ties with Russia found themselves on Friday with an unusual - and perhaps unwelcome - ally.\n",

      "As Republicans called for the release of a classified memorandum that they say shows anti-Trump bias at the Justice Department, a network of Kremlin-controlled Twitter [TWTR.N]accounts swung into action to amplify that demand, according to specialists who monitor online activity sponsored by Moscow.\n",
      "The use of the hashtag #releasethememo increased 315,500 percent in roughly 24 hours on 600 Twitter accounts known or suspected to be under Kremlin influence, according to the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a project of the nonpartisan German Marshall Fund think tank.\n",
      "\"I've never seen anything quite like it, \" said Bret Schafer, an analyst at the Alliance.\n",
      "The data can be seen at: here\n",
      "There is no evidence that the Republican and Russian-backed attacks on Mueller are coordinated, but the storm underscores the role social media can play in driving political discourse.\n",
      "The #releasethememo Twitter cloudburst also appears to be a microcosm of what U.S. intelligence officials say are Kremlin efforts to fan political divisions in the United States after having meddled in the 2016 presidential election, according to a declassified January 2017 U.S. intelligence assessment.\n",
      "Wikileaks, the transparency group that published emails from Democratic Party organizations that U.S. intelligence officials say were stolen by Russian military intelligence during the 2016 campaign, on Friday offered to match a reward of up to $1 million for anyone who gives it the memo.\n",

      "Dutch security services watched Russian hackers break into email accounts at the State Department, the White House, and the Democratic National Committee and passed critical intelligence along to U.S. officials between 2014 and 2016, according to a report Thursday in the Dutch news outlets Nieuwsuur and Volkskrant.\n",
      "This intelligence from Dutch security services reportedly prompted the Federal Bureau of Investigations to first look into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n",
      "In the summer of 2014, Dutch AIVD and MIVD intelligence agencies infiltrated computers used by Cozy Bear, one of two state-sponsored Russian hacking operations U.S. intelligence officials believe swiped emails and other documents from the DNC in 2016. Their goal was to influence the general election in favor of President Donald Trump.\n",
      "At the time, Cozy Bear was based out of a university building near Red Square, in Moscow, the outlets reported. Dutch intelligence infiltrated their systems so completely that they were able to capture security footage of the hackers as they entered and exited the room where they worked.\n",
      "Most significantly, the Dutch spies captured footage that proves Cozy Bear operated under the direction of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, according to Volkskrant.\n",
      "The new report cites \"six American and Dutch sources who are familiar with the material, but wish to remain anonymous, \" according to Volkskrant.\n",
      "Last April, The Washington Post first reported details of a 24-hour pitched battle that occurred in 2014 between the U.S. National Security Agency and Russian hackers who had infiltrated unclassified State Department email systems.\n",
      "\"It was hand-to-hand combat, \" former NSA Deputy Director Richard Legett told a cyber forum at the Aspen Institute last March, according to The Post.\n",

      "In the fall of 2016, a little more than a month before Donald Trump was elected president, Christopher Steele had the undivided attention of the FBI.\n",
      "For months, the British former spy had been working to alert the Americans to what he believed were disturbing ties Trump had to Russia. He had grown so worried about what he had learned from his Russia network about the Kremlin's plans that he told colleagues it was like \"sitting on a nuclear weapon.\"\n",
      "He was now being summoned to Rome, where he spent hours in a discreet location telling four American officials — some of whom had flown in from the United States — about his findings.\n",
      "The Russians had damaging information about Trump's personal behavior and finances that could be used to pressure the GOP nominee. What's more, the Kremlin was now carrying out an operation with the Trump campaign's help to tilt the U.S. election — a plot Steele had been told was ordered by President Vladi­mir Putin.\n",
      "The FBI investigators treated Steele as a peer, a Russia expert so well-trusted that he had assisted the Justice Department on past cases and provided briefing material for British prime ministers and at least one U.S. president. During intense questioning that day in Rome, they alluded to some of their own findings of ties between Russia and the Trump campaign and raised the prospect of paying Steele to continue gathering intelligence after Election Day, according to people familiar with the discussion.\n",
      "But Steele was not one of them. He had left the famed Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6, seven years earlier and was now working on behalf of Fusion GPS, a private Washington research firm whose work at the time was funded by Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, and the Democratic Party.\n",
      "The meeting in Rome captured the unusual and complicated role of Steele, who wrote memos that came to be known as the dossier and who has become the central point of contention in the political brawl raging around the Russia inquiry by special \n",

      "On Friday, Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer was busy negotiating a deal with Donald Trump that would have kept the government open and protected DREAMers by enshrining the program known as DACA into law. It looked like an agreement was close at hand, but then suddenly, late in the day, it got scotched. So what the hell happened?\n",
      "As the evening wore on, Mr. Schumer got a call from Mr. Kelly that dashed all hopes for a Trump-Schumer deal before the shutdown deadline of midnight. Mr. Kelly, a hard-liner on immigration, the person familiar with the call said, outlined a long list of White House objections to the deal.\n",
      "So yep, Trump's chief of staff, John Kelly, shredded the deal because, as the AP's confirmatory account put it, it was \"too liberal.\" That is to say, safeguarding the rights of 800,000 people who were brought into this country as minors was too much for Kelly to stomach.\n",
      "It's no surprise, though. Before he went to the White House, Kelly headed up the Department of Homeland Security, where he gave a green light to its notorious customs division, ICE, to round up and expel as many immigrants as possible with abject cruelty. Of course a man who revels in ripping apart families would hate DACA.\n",
      "But whether Kelly was channeling Trump or freelancing, make no mistake: This is still the #TrumpShutdown. After all, Kelly works for Trump and reports directly to him. If Trump still wants to pursue his deal with Schumer, then all he has to do is tell Kelly to shut up and pick up the phone to Chuck. The fact that he hasn't affirms that this shutdown rest squarely on Trump's shoulders.\n",

      "The poem today is about one of my favourite parks I used to visit as a child, Judson's Recreation Ground, named after local businessman, Frank Judson, who donated the land in 1949. It was known simply to me as \"The Rec.\" Looking back I am surprised that we don't have any photos of the park considering we visited so frequently. We don't actually have a lot of photographs of any of us taken at the park. I guess not a lot of people carried cameras back then. Plus, like my own children, I doubt very much if we stood still for long. I actually have quite a few pictures and videos of my boys at various playgrounds. Great inventions, smart phones!\n",
      "However I can picture it so clearly in my mind and I was pleased when my husband said that the following poem built a picture of the park in his mind. I hope it does the same for you too: (and if anyone happens to have any photographs of Judson's Recreation Ground in the 80s, please feel free to share)\n",

      "The business editor of the Los Angeles Times made a triumphant return to the newsroom to applause Thursday after several days away, telling colleagues she had been whisked away and suspended as part of the newspaper's investigation into the leak of taped remarks made by the paper's editor-in-chief in November.\n",
      "According to several staffers, Business Editor Kimi Yoshino told members of the LA Times business desk that the then editor-in-chief, Lewis D'Vorkin, personally walked her to human resources offices last week. Yoshino said she was then grilled over a conversation she had with New York Times reporter Sydney Ember in advance of a story published in that paper.\n",
      "That story revealed that reporters clashed with D'Vorkin at a November newsroom meeting over his handling of the Walt Disney Co.'s condemnations of the LA Times for its coverage of financial breaks given by the City of Anaheim to the entertainment giant. D'Vorkin had not publicly defended the LA Times' reporting even as Disney blocked LA Times reporters and critics from advance screenings of its films, inhibiting cultural coverage and movie reviews. The company lifted the ban after a meeting with D'Vorkin and LA Times Publisher Ross Levinsohn.\n",
      "Yoshino denied sharing any audio with the New York Times reporter, telling colleagues she simply had an innocuous conversation with Ember shortly before the story.\n",
      "The leak of the staff meeting and the subsequent story in the rival New York Times incensed D'Vorkin and LA Times Publisher Ross Levinsohn, who called New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet to complain, according to a spokeswoman for the New York paper.

In sworn testimony, Levinsohn reportedly acknowledged that he had rated the bodies and relative \"hotness\" of women who worked at AltaVista.\n",

      "\"As a result, long-time aide Kevin Quinn is no longer an employee of any of my political committees. Mr. Quinn has worked with my political offices for nearly 20 years. While this is the only allegation of such conduct, Mr. Quinn also recently pled guilty to misdemeanor disorderly conduct. Based on the culmination of events, Alderman Marty Quinn and I decided that Kevin should no longer be affiliated with the political organization. For the record, Kevin was previously an employee of my State office, and he will not be returning to that role, \" Madigan said.\n",

Since the start of the new year, 18 states and 19 cities have seen an increase in minimum wages, according to the National Employment Law Project, with an additional three states and 18 cities and counties poised to make increases later this year.

      "Despite employment growth, the food chain pays the lowest hourly median wage to frontline workers compared to workers in all other industries.

      "A year ago, panicked friends were writing to ask me what to do now that the United States had elected Donald Trump. Like I'd know: I had spent years writing and organizing in opposition to Vladimir Putin, only to have to leave Russia. But a decade and a half in Putin's Russia taught me something about living in an autocracy. I am familiar with the ways in which it numbs the mind and drains the spirit. I wrote a piece called \"Autocracy: Rules for Survival, \" which was published by The New York Review of Books and read by millions of people. Today seems a good day to look at how well my proposed rules have held up.\n",
      "Rule No. 1: Believe the autocrat. I argued against the expectation that Trump would change in the months following the election, becoming somehow \"Presidential\" and abandoning his more extreme positions. This belief, it seemed to me, stemmed from the inability to absorb the fact of a Trump Presidency, and not from any historical precedents of similar transformations. The best predictors of autocrats' and aspiring autocrats' behavior are their own public statements, because these statements brought them to power in the first place.\n",
      "Trump had repeatedly made several promises that many people hoped or expected he would drop post-election: to build a wall on the border with Mexico, to repeal Obamacare, to ban Muslims from entering the United States, and, of course, to \"lock her up!\" I wrote, \"If Trump does not go after Hillary Clinton on his first day in office, if he instead focuses, as his acceptance speech indicated he might, on the unifying project of investing in infrastructure (which, not coincidentally, would provide an instant opportunity to reward his cronies and himself), it will be foolish to breathe a sigh of relief. Trump has made his plans clear, and he has made a compact with his voters to carry them out. These plans include not only dismantling legislation such as Obamacare but also doing away with judicial restraint — and, yes, punishing oppone\n",

      "In front of 20,000 people who had marched for equality, and during a time of crushing poverty and racist laws and policies affecting many African-Americans, Dr. King famously asked in 1965: \"How long will it take?\" And then he answered his own question, paraphrasing abolitionist Theodore Parker: \"Not long, because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\"\n",
      "The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. speaking. (Photo by Julian Wasser/Getty Images)\n",
      "Dr. King believed in the collective power of individual action, that it could propel us forward along the arc toward equality. And that the systemic inequality at the core of America did not afford anyone the option of standing idly by.\n",
      "These words and teachings have held a special significance over the past year. There are many reminders that this is far from a normal chapter in our country's history. Hate crimes are on the rise; marginalized communities are threatened; cruel and discriminatory federal policies threaten to undermine our progress and the values of our country; and racist rhetoric literally flows from the highest levels of power.\n",

It has rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, leaving the lives of hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants hanging in the balance.

There was one unequivocal success: A president who, over the course of his first 12 months in that office, has often seemed unmoored or uncontrolled on Tuesday night offered a composed, deliberate vision of what his presidency could be.\n",
      "He looked, for [one of the few times/the first time] of his presidency, like America's president.\n",
      "Having pledged to offer America a vision of the unity that has so far eluded him, Trump made a powerful case for the American Dream, anchoring it in his glowing evaluations of the economy. Pointing to growth in the stock market since the 2016 election, Trump made the argument that this success offered an opportunity for Americans to put petty disputes behind them. A strong economy, he argued, would lead to a strong America. [Add quotation marks to that sentence as needed.]\n",

      "\"Presidents usually regard the oath as a set of legally binding principles that they abide by, \" Mr. Brettschneider said. \"Trump tends to think of things in terms of real estate law — ways to get around legal requirements rather than enforcing and promoting them. That's scary, because we rely on a president to espouse the norms of the Constitution.\"\n",
      "Sometimes Mr. Trump's constitutional illiteracy is amusing, like the time he told a group of Republican senators that he wanted to protect \"Article XII, \" which doesn't exist. More often it's alarming. He has shown disdain for the separation of powers by repeatedly attacking the federal judiciary and individual judges who have ruled against him. He has made a mockery of the emoluments clause by refusing to divest his tangled business empire and profiting openly off his presidency . He has abused the pardon power by granting his first, and so far only, pardon to a former sheriff who was found in contempt of a federal court for defying an order.

      "Backers said the changes were long overdue, arguing that Colorado's ballot access laws make it too easy to change the state constitution — which ranks among the longest and most convoluted in the country.

Previously, signature gathering efforts have typically been concentrated within the major population centers of the Front Range.\n",

      "President Donald Trump is nominating white men to America's federal courts at a rate not seen in nearly 30 years, threatening to reverse a slow transformation toward a judiciary that reflects the nation's diversity.\n",
      "So far, 91 percent of Trump's nominees are white, and 81 percent are male, an Associated Press analysis has found. Three of every four are white men, with few African-Americans and Hispanics in the mix. The last president to nominate a similarly homogenous group was George H.W. Bush.\n",
      "The shift could prove to be one of Trump's most enduring legacies. These are lifetime appointments, and Trump has inherited both an unusually high number of vacancies and an aging population of judges. That puts him in position to significantly reshape the courts that decide thousands of civil rights, environmental, criminal justice and other disputes across the country. The White House has been upfront about its plans to quickly fill the seats with conservatives, and has made clear that judicial philosophy tops any concerns about shrinking racial or gender diversity.\n",
      "Trump is anything but shy about his plans, calling his imprint on the courts an \"untold story\" of his presidency.\n",

      "A voter registration event in Philadelphia last year. Critics say Pennsylvania's Congressional district map is one of the most gerrymandered in the country.CreditRuth Fremson/The New York Times\n",
      "WASHINGTON — Pennsylvania's congressional district map is a partisan gerrymander that \"clearly, plainly and palpably\" violates the state's Constitution , the State Supreme Court said on Monday, adding to a string of court decisions striking down political maps that unduly favor one political party.\n",
      "The court banned the current map of the state's 18 House districts from being used in this year's primary and general elections, and ordered that a new map be submitted to the court by Feb. 15. But the state's Republican-dominated Legislature, which approved the current map in 2011, has already said it would try to overturn such a decision in federal court. That would set up another legal battle over gerrymanders in a year already filled with them.\n",
      "But an appeal to the federal courts would very likely fail, election experts said, because decisions based solely on interpretations of state law — as this one appears to be — are generally beyond the reach of federal judges.\n",
      "For the same reason, the state court's decision has no direct bearing on a string of challenges to partisan gerrymanders that are already moving through the federal court system. Earlier this month, in fact, a divided panel of three federal judges left intact the same Pennsylvania House map that the state court threw out on Monday.\n",

      "Wells Fargo's headquarters in San Francisco. The bank, in a settlement with the Federal Reserve, was banned from getting bigger.CreditMax Whittaker for The New York Times\n",
      "On a Thursday evening in mid-January, a group of top Wells Fargo executives sat down for dinner in an upscale surf-and-turf restaurant near the White House. At nearby tables, power brokers ate seafood on ice and sipped cocktails out of copper mugs.\n",
      "The Wells Fargo executives — including the chief executive, Timothy J. Sloan, and the finance chief, John R. Shrewsberry — enjoyed their crab legs, but they were in Washington on unpleasant business. The Federal Reserve planned to impose tough sanctions on the San Francisco-based bank for years of misconduct and the shoddy governance that allowed it.\n",
      "The executives' mission, according to three people directly involved in the negotiations, was to avoid further shaking investor confidence in the bank and its management team.\n",
      "Officials at the central bank had a different goal, according to people familiar with their thinking. They wanted to send a message to the Wells board that it would be held responsible for the company's behavior.\n",
      "After three weeks of frenzied negotiations, a deal was announced on Friday night that represented a milestone in the evolving relationship between regulators and banks. Wells Fargo, one of the country's largest banks, was banned from getting bigger until it can convince regulators that it has cleaned up its act.\n",
      "\"We cannot tolerate pervasive and persistent misconduct at any bank, \" Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, said in a statement on Friday. It was her last act at the Fed; hours later she finished her four-year term.\n",

      "On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on the nomination of Michael Brennan to become a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which oversees district courts in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin. Brennan came to wide attention after a January hearing where he could not answer questions from Senator Cory Booker (D-N.J.) about whether there is implicit racial bias in the criminal justice system.\n",
      "Brennan also has the distinction of being the second Trump judicial nominee to move forward without a so-called \"blue slip\" from both of his home state senators. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), did not return the document signaling her approval of the nomination. As I explained in a previous story:\n",
      "\"The blue slip process is a longstanding tradition — not a law — designed to ensure meaningful consultation between a presidential administration and senators over potential federal judges. Under the system, senators from the judicial nominees' home states are asked to sign slips of approval before the confirmation process can continue. When a senator refuses to return a blue slip, the act typically blocks the nominee from moving ahead. It is one of the few levers available to both parties to block objectionable nominees.\"\n"

Grassley's announcement and the question of when nominees will be allowed to progress without blue slip approval have been an ongoing source of controversy.

      "The 6-foot-2 junior made six straight shots and finished 8-for-11, leading all players with 17 points and 12 rebounds.\n",
      "In the end, however, that's almost all the Redhawks could muster. As a result, the DuPage Valley Conference championship is still up for grabs after the host Tigers pulled off a 41-33 upset in Wheaton.\n",
      "Naperville Central (22-5, 12-1), which had a seven-game winning streak snapped, still controls its own destiny. But the Tigers (20-3, 10-2) remain alive after avenging an earlier 48-28 defeat.\n",
      "\"They're such a good defensive team, \" Schmid said. \"We knew we had to prepare for that but they just put a lot of pressure on us and we didn't really prepare, I don't think, for that.\n",
      "\"We didn't pass the ball well enough and we got a lot of turnovers, which hurt us in the end.\"\n",
      "The Tigers, who held an opponent under 35 points for the 17th time this season, relied mainly on their 2-3 zone defense. They held Penn-bound Mia Lakstigala scoreless until the 5:33 mark of the fourth quarter.\n",
      "Lakstigala, who is second on Naperville Central's career scoring list, missed her first six shots and finished with eight points on 3-for-10 shooting. Freshman Gabi Melby also had eight points, but no other Redhawk scored.\n",
      "\"That was crazy, \" Schmid said. \"That hurt us, Mia not being able to score.\n",

      "Even though elephants are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act, a provision in the act allows the government to give permits to import such trophies if there is evidence that the hunting benefits conservation for that species. The official said the administration has new information from officials in Zimbabwe and Zambia to support reversing the ban.\n",

      "\"Legal, well-regulated sport hunting as part of a sound management program can benefit the conservation of certain species by providing incentives to local communities to conserve the species and by putting much-needed revenue back into conservation, \" a Fish and Wildlife spokesperson said in a statement.\n",
      "This change applies only to elephants in those two countries. It prompted questions about using game hunting to generate money for conservation efforts, and similar questions arose after the controversial killing of Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe in 2015.\n",
      "The government has not officially announced this policy change yet, but it was reportedly raised at a wildlife forum in South Africa this week, according to Safari Club International, which filed a lawsuit to block the 2014 ban.\n",

      "When the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission approved its designation as a landmark in 1967, early in the push to recognize and preserve places with connections to history, it described the house as \"a distinguished residence\" with \"special character.\" But, as Mr. Benepe noted, \"there are some problems\" now. The house is dilapidated. It was damaged by an electrical fire several years ago and has not been lived in since then. The plaster ceilings upstairs suffered damage when the roof leaked.\n",
      "And then there is the wet basement. After the fire, there was no electricity, and with no electricity, the sump pump did not work, said Carlotta DeFillo, who grew up in the house and whose son lived there until the fire. Fortunately, the house escaped damage when Hurricane Sandy churned across Staten Island in 2012.\n",

      "Judge William J. Martinez's order stops short of striking the amendment down but pledges to block a significant part of it from being enacted unless Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams can convince him otherwise.\n",
      "If the judge follows through with an injunction, it could have significant consequences for the 2018 ballot. Some advocacy groups that are considering pursuing statutory ballot initiatives may change course and pursue constitutional measures. Meanwhile, those that are seeking constitutional changes would face a much easier path.\n",
      "Amendment 71, dubbed \"Raise the Bar\" by supporters, lifts the threshold for passage of constitutional amendments to 55 percent of the vote. And, to get on the ballot, measures now need signatures from 2 percent of registered voters in all 35 state Senate districts.\n",
      "Backers said the changes were long overdue, arguing that Colorado's ballot access laws make it too easy to change the state constitution — which ranks among the longest and most convoluted in the country. And, they said, the Senate district requirement is needed to give rural Colorado more say in what goes on the ballot. Previously, signature gathering efforts have typically been concentrated within the major population centers of the Front Range.\n",

      "The Cleveland Cavaliers have traded Dwyane Wade to the Miami Heat in a stunning deal, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. Wade, of course, was a Heat lifer before joining the Chicago Bulls last season and signing in Cleveland before the year started.\n",
      "In return, Cleveland is receiving a \"heavily protected\" second-round selection from Miami, per Wojnarowski.\n",
      "Now Wade's back in Miami, leaving his good friend LeBron James in Cleveland in the midst of a flurry of moves that completely rebuilds the Cavaliers roster. Though we expected fireworks from Koby Altman and the Cavaliers' front office, Wade had never once been rumored to be on the move, since he's an aging player with minimal value and few expected him to depart given his relationship with James.\n",
      "Wade's role in Cleveland has been the smallest of his career, averaging a career-low 23 minutes and 11 points per game on well-below-league-average efficiency. Though we would occasionally see flashes of the Wade of old, he was mostly a bit-part role player who didn't necessarily help the team. Even the famed James and Wade chemistry didn't really seem to be there.\n",
      "As such, it's not a huge surprise to see that Wade was moveable, and that he would even support such a move. The Heat need another bench scorer after losing Dion Waiters for the year, and Wade is obviously extremely comfortable with that organization, even with his awkward exit in the summer of 2016.\n",
      "Even James supports the move, posting this on Instagram.\n",
      "Cleveland looks completely different now, and Miami gets back the best player in its franchise history. This was unexpected, but it makes sense for both sides.\n"

      "THE BIG IDEA: Republican women who voted for President Trump in North Carolina said during a focus group Wednesday night that they are embarrassed by and exasperated with him.\n",
      "-- Annie Anthony, 56, voted for Trump last year because she opposes abortion and did not like how Hillary Clinton handled Benghazi. Now she fears that Trump is marching us toward war with North Korea. She describes the first 10 months of his presidency as \"chaotic, stressful and an uphill battle.\"\n",
      "\"While I thought his ideas appealed to me, since he's been in there he's embarrassed me by his behavior, \" said Anthony, a divorced college graduate who runs a local nonprofit volunteer center and drives for Uber to make ends meet. \"He behaves so unpresidential. The words he uses. The tweeting. I mean, he dresses nice. And Melania is looking good. When he was away (in Asia), he was great at being a president. He's the showman. But here at home, I can't imagine how they let him build a country club — let alone be in one. Because adults don't behave that way. I've been surprised that a billionaire would behave the way he has ...\n",
      "\"I don't have a problem with him tweeting, \" she continued. \"I follow him because I want to see what he's saying myself and not have someone interpret it for me. But I think that his language is unprofessional. He uses words like 'sad' and 'bad.' That's first grade language. We're an intelligent population who elected you. Represent us!\"\n",
      "Anthony, a registered Republican, remains hopeful that Congress will soon pass tax cuts, but she's nervous that they'll take away the deduction for charitable donations. She's also worried that, if her health insurance rates continue to go up, she won't be able to afford to go see the doctor any more. (She makes less than $50,000 a year.)\n",

      "Some members of the Trump administration started off the holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr. at a wreath-laying ceremony at the civil rights leader's memorial in Washington Monday. But the president's first stop was his own golf club.\n",
      "Trump signed a federal holiday proclamation at the White House on Friday where he praised King for his leadership in the civil rights movement. And, in words that echoed every president before him since 1994, Trump encouraged \"all Americans to observe this day with acts of civic work and community service in honor of Dr. King's extraordinary life.\"\n",
      "Yet, it appears Trump ignored his own inspiring message. He spent most of the day at his own Mar-a-Lago resort in West Palm Beach, Florida.\n",
      "Although he retweeted an official White House video in which he pays tribute to King, there is no indication he intends to participate in any public services before returning to Washington in the afternoon.\n",
      "The absence of volunteer plans by Trump is especially glaring as he faces accusations of racism following reports that he made derogatory comments about Haiti and African nations.\n",
      "He has since denied those reports and on Sunday told reporters, \"I am the least racist person you will ever interview.\"\n",
      "But his refusals have done little to stem criticism from leaders at King's former church in Atlanta. As Molly Samuel of member station WABE reports, the Rev. Raphael Warnock addressed the congregation gathered Monday morning at the Ebenezer Baptist Church saying, \"I was still reeling in the reports just hours earlier about a volcanic eruption of hate speech spewing out of the mouth of the same man.\"\n",

Kelly first found his credibility being challenged in October, when he leveraged his standing as a retired four-star Marine Corps general who had lost a son on the battlefield to try to contain a political crisis over President Trump's calls to the families of fallen soldiers.\n",
      "His reputation took another hit when he later refused to apologize for falsely attacking a Democratic congresswoman. And another when he called Confederate Gen. Robert E.

      "After the White House staff secretary was accused of domestic violence by both of his ex-wives, Kelly publicly defended Porter as \"a man of true integrity and honor, \" adding, \"I can't say enough good things about him.\" Privately, Kelly reportedly urged him to stay in his job.\n",
      "Kelly's actions left his critics — as well as some West Wing subordinates — questioning how much credibility he has left.\n",
      "\"To have a chief of staff defend the integrity of a person who's been credibly accused of being a wife beater is just stunning . . . and unconscionable, \" said Peter Wehner, who has served in the three previous Republican administrations and opposes Trump. \"What he's done as chief of staff doesn't undo what he did as a heroic war figure, but it diminishes him as a person, and that's regrettable.\"\n",
      "Kelly's luster has slowly eroded during his roughly six months as Trump's top staffer — and some White House aides worry it may be acutely painful, considering he takes personal pride in his honor as a lifelong public servant.\n",

Since the start of the new year, 18 states and 19 cities have seen an increase in minimum wages, according to the National Employment Law Project, with an additional three states and 18 cities and counties poised to make increases later this year. These efforts to uplift people out of poverty are essential: the official poverty rate in the United States in 2016 (the latest year we have statistics for) was 12.7%. For children under the age of 18, the official rate was 18%. While these are slight decreases (of about 1%) from the preceding year, this still translates into over 40 million people living in poverty.\n",

This is detailed in my book, as well as in the recent report from the Food Chain Workers Alliance and Solidarity Research Cooperative, titled \"No Piece of the Pie: U.S. Food Workers in 2016, \" that stated:\n",
      "Despite employment growth, the food chain pays the lowest hourly median wage to frontline workers compared to workers in all other industries.

      "Oath, the Verizon-owned news brand that encompasses Yahoo, AOL, The HuffPo and more, is relaunching its \"Newsroom\" app today.\n",
      "Why it matters: The relaunch is a part of a larger push to center Oath's content strategy around customizable and mobile-first video. Oath CEO Tim Armstrong has been vocal about how the company's scale will be a driving force in its ability to take on Google and Facebook's advertising dominance.\n",
      "What they're saying:\n",
      "\"There's a hole in the market for what this is, \" says Alex Wallace, Head of Oath Studios. \"There is nothing comparable with this much video in it that's optimized with this mobile experience.\"\n",
      "\"We want users to be able to engage content both quickly and deeply, \" says Oath's Global Head of News Jared Grusd. \"The app will be different from Facebook or other platforms that feature news, because it won't necessarily center around one News Feed, but rather an infinite number of 'vibes' — think of them like Spotify playlists, \" Grusd says.\n",
      "The relaunch will include 14 new original video series, each designed to only be a few minutes in length, and made for vertical video consumption on mobile. The new slate of programming will draw from Oath's 3,000 publishing partners, ranging from Yahoo Sports to TechCrunch to Conde Nast. Another ten news series will debut by the end of the year.\n",
      "The relaunch and new programming push is a part of a broader video effort by Oath to capitalize on the scale of content it has access to from premium brands. Earlier this year, Oath's launched a new video product called \"Slick\" that allows it to quickly convert text-based stories to videos using machine learning.\n",

Politicians, businesses, athletes, and artists use platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to share new ideas, sell new products, and promote their brand. These applications have also made it substantially easier to develop a following by going viral AKA the holy grail for brands the world over.\n",

HQ is a trivia quiz show that comes on at 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. ET everyday and offers contestants a chance to win cash prizes for answering 12 questions correctly.

      "1. Focus On High Quality Content Before Investing In Advertising\n",
      "One mistake many brands make when marketing on social media is focusing on advertising campaigns rather than high quality content creation. While successful brands certainly have great marketing strategies, they also regularly put out quality content to keep customers engaged.\n",
      "Ayoub tells me that \"content is and always will be the key to a brand's success.\" He added further that \"I'd definitely say before investing into advertising, make sure your content is on point otherwise you'll end up wasting money advertising something that doesn't work.\" So If you're not able to keep customers engaged once they've visited your page with content, advertising is useless.\n",

      "When it comes to video advertising, small businesses have to navigate and adapt to a sea of changes -- most recently Facebook's algorithm news . Having delved into what the changes mean for my company, we realized the new algorithm isn't as harmful as it may initially seem. Simply put, it means small businesses need to start zeroing in on the video methods that have worked in the past and incorporate them into their daily video marketing strategies. Instead of trying to figure out a way around Facebook's recent changes, learn how to capitalize on them, creating video content that will keep you high in your customers' feeds.\n",
      "With that said, Mark Zuckerberg's announcement that Facebook is shifting the focus of its news feed to favor personal stories and exchanges between users has once again left small businesses and video marketers without a clear roadmap of what's ahead. But before you abandon ship, here are three ways your business can use the new algorithm to your advantage and set your brand up for success on social media.\n",
      "Quality is priority — create valuable content.\n",
      "Ultimately, the news feed will favor posts that foster genuine engagement and meaningful social interaction -- posts that receive more shares, likes and comments. For small businesses, this means your video content should encourage dialogue between users. Consider the following guidelines to keep your brand top of mind.\n",
      "• Whether it's holiday related or drawing on a trending topic, make sure your video content is relevant to your community.\n",
      "• Try an educational video featuring your product to draw folks in and foster trust in your brand.\n",
      "• Instead of content that is focused on a product or service, create a video ad that cultivates a human connection while featuring your product or service. See how our customer, Brothers Commercial Brokerage,\n",

      "iOS users who want to try the AR experience will need to have the latest version of the NYT iOS app, the latest version of iOS, and an iPhone SE, an iPhone 6S or newer, a fifth-generation iPad or an iPad Pro.\n",
      "To get started, you'll need to give the app access to your iPhone or iPad's camera, when requested, then point your phone at some non-reflective surface, like the floor in the room, for example.

      "A second federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending protections for Dreamers — undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. The ruling requires the Department of Homeland Security to continue accepting renewal applications for Dreamers protected by the Obama-era Deferred Action for Child Arrivals (DACA) program, which President Donald Trump moved to end last year.\n",
      "Tuesday's ruling from New York district court judge Nicholas Garaufis follows a similar preliminary injunction issued last month by California judge William Alsup. As Mother Jones has written, the Trump administration has taken the rare step of appealing Alsup's decision straight to the Supreme Court. But it has not sought not to immediately stop, or \"stay, \" the injunction. As a result, DACA renewals are likely to remain open for months, and possibly through the November midterm elections.\n",
      "Both district court rulings require DHS to accept applications from DACA recipients whose protections are expiring, as well as those whose two-year work permits have already expired. They do not require DHS to accept applications from people who have never been protected by DACA.\n",
      "Garaufis did not dispute that the Trump administration has the authority to end DACA. Instead, his decision holds that the administration likely violated a federal statute known as the Administrative Procedure Act by winding down DACA in an \"arbitrary and capricious\" manner. He concluded that a temporary injunction is necessary because ending DACA would likely cause \"irreparable harm\" to DACA recipients:\n",
      "If the decision is allowed to go into effect prior to a full adjudication on the merits, there is no way the court can \"unscramble the egg\" and undo the damage caused by what, on the record before it, appears to have been a patently arbitrary and capricious decision.\n",

But surprisingly often we stumble across fascinating biological phenomena when we are not really doing science. That is how we discovered 'fungal highways' in cheese rinds as described in our recent Nature Communications paper.\n",

Normally we were hard at work in the lab processing genomic sequencing data or reconstructing microbial communities on in vitro cheese. But on this night, we were working on an art-science collaboration.\n",

      "\"Whatever I'm doing as a songwriter to help them tell their stories, they're giving it back to me double, triple, quadruple, \" said Gauthier (pronounced go-SHAY). \"We're helping each other in a really lonely world. We are going into relationships that are real, and that's the most you can ask for in anything.\"\n",
      "The latest manifestation of that work is \"Rifles and Rosary Beads, \" an album of 11 songs she wrote with veterans -- both men and women. She also collaborated with soldiers' spouses and partners. All told, it's a powerful work with a perspective that's rarely tapped so directly. The Times is premiering the full album, which will be released on Jan. 26.\n",
      "\"A lot of songwriters have written about soldiers and war, \" Gauthier, 55, said, \"but very few have written with them.\"\n",

      "(CNN) A total of 210,000 gallons of oil leaked Thursday from the Keystone Pipeline in South Dakota, the pipeline's operator, TransCanada, said.\n",
      "Crews shut down the pipeline Thursday morning, and officials are investigating the cause of the leak, which occurred about three miles southeast of the town of Amherst, said Brian Walsh, a spokesman for the state's Department of Environment and Natural Resources.\n",
      "This is the largest Keystone oil spill to date in South Dakota, Walsh said. The leak comes just days before Nebraska officials announce a decision on whether the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline, a sister project, can move forward.\n",
      "In April 2016, there was a 400-barrel release -- or 16,800 gallons -- with the majority of the oil cleanup completed in two months, Walsh said. About 5,000 barrels of oil spilled Thursday.\n",
      "\"It is a below-ground pipeline, but some oil has surfaced above ground to the grass, \" Walsh said. \"It will be a few days until they can excavate and get in borings to see if there is groundwater contamination.\"\n",
      "There were no initial reports of the oil spill affecting waterways, water systems or wildlife, he said.\n",
      "The pipeline was shut down \"within minutes\" of the company discovering an irregularity, TransCanada said Friday. The spill has been controlled, the company said, with no further environmental impacts observed and no threat to public safety.\n",
      "TransCanada said it was working with state and federal agencies.\n",
      "\"The safety of the public and environment are our top priorities and we will continue to provide updates as they become available, \" the company said.\n",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency is monitoring the situation and will provide resources and assistance if needed, a spokesman said.\n",

      "Back to Gallery\n",
      "President Donald Trump's announcement of a 30 percent tariff on foreign solar panel technology is driving fears of a \"shock\" to Asian manufacturers, the growth of which has driven down solar prices in recent years.\n",
      "Frank Yu, a Bejing-based consultant with Wood Mackenzie, wrote in a note to investors Monday, \"the duty barrier will shock Asian suppliers in the near term and they will likely switch gears to penetrate more into the growing Asian markets to offset the impact.\"\n",
      "Trump announced the tariff after two U.S. solar manufacturers filed suit with the International Trade Commission, arguing tariffs would boost a domestic industry that has struggled to keep pace with Chinese and Taiwanese competitors.\n",
      "The move is expected to slow down U.S. solar developers, who rely on foreign manufacturers for an estimated 80 percent of their solar technology.\n",
      "\"The solar industry has been tested before and we have always shown our resiliency, \" said John Berger, CEO of Houston-based Sunnova Energy. \"Residential solar costs have come down significantly across the industry over the last five years and we expect those cost declines to continue, despite tariffs.\"\n",
      "For now, Trump's maneuvering on trade is expected to do little to quell the dominance of East Asia's solar industry, which operates on a scale that makes it difficult for U.S. companies to compete on price.\n",
      "\"China won't get hit as much as its domestic market is still growing strong. In addition, emerging markets such as India is likely to draw more Southeast Asian production to feed its solar capacity growth, \" Yu wrote.\n",

      "The release of ISO New England's Operational Fuel-Security Analysis is the result of a year-long assessment of whether possible future resource combinations would have enough fuel to ensure reliability in the region's power generation network throughout an entire winter. The 56-page study grew out of the Holyoke, Massachusetts-based grid operator's experiences operating the system through challenging winter conditions in 2014, as well as its observations regarding trends affecting power system operations.\n",
      "Gordon van Welie, chief executive officer of ISO New England, said the goal of the survey is \"to understand the future implications of several significant trends already affecting grid operations.\"\n",
      "\"The results aren't a prediction, but they do shine a light on the potential reliability consequences of retirements of generators with stored fuels and the significance of liquefied natural gas, imports, renewables, and oil inventories at dual-fuel power plants, \" van Welie said in a statement. \"With this information, we can begin a discussion with regional stakeholders about how to ensure continued power system reliability.\"\n",
      "The key conclusions of the study indicate that the region is vulnerable to the season-long outage of any of several major energy facilities and that power system reliability is heavily dependent on the import of liquid natural gas and electricity from outside the region.\n",
      "One possible solution is to build more power plants with dual-fuel capability, which can switch between natural gas and oil. But obtaining permits to build and operate those facilities is difficult, the survey concludes.\n",

      "On the surface, it's an empowered start to 2018 for those in the workforce. Since the start of the new year, 18 states and 19 cities have seen an increase in minimum wages, according to the National Employment Law Project, with an additional three states and 18 cities and counties poised to make increases later this year. These efforts to uplift people out of poverty are essential: the official poverty rate in the United States in 2016 (the latest year we have statistics for) was 12.7%. For children under the age of 18, the official rate was 18%. While these are slight decreases (of about 1%) from the preceding year, this still translates into over 40 million people living in poverty.\n",
      "One in seven Americans are hungry — not because there isn't enough food, but because they don't have the money to buy it. Ironically, these numbers include a disproportionate number of people working in the food industry. This is detailed in my book, as well as in the recent report from the Food Chain Workers Alliance and Solidarity Research Cooperative, titled \"No Piece of the Pie: U.S. Food Workers in 2016, \" that stated:\n",
      "Despite employment growth, the food chain pays the lowest hourly median wage to frontline workers compared to workers in all other industries. The annual median wage for food chain workers is $16,000 and the hourly median wage is $10, well below the median wages across all industries of $36,468 and $17.53.\n",

Thirteen percent of all food workers, nearly 2.8 million workers, relied on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits (food stamps) to feed their household in 2016.

One, compiled by Politico, runs to nearly 12,000 words — an almost book-length account of stupidity, cynicism, hubris and corruption at the highest levels of American politics.\n",
      "The cumulative effect on the reader is a kind of nausea no pill can cure. Most recently, we learned about Donald Trump Jr.'s direct communications with WikiLeaks — which CIA Director Mike Pompeo has called \"a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia\" — during its efforts to produce incriminating material on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election. But this is one sentence in an epic of corruption. There is the narrative of a campaign in which high-level operatives believed that Russian espionage could help secure the American presidency, and acted on that belief. There is the narrative of deception to conceal the nature and extent of Russian ties. And there is the narrative of a president attempting to prevent or shut down the investigation of those ties and soliciting others for help in that task.\n",

      "(Reuters) - Suncor Energy Inc said on Wednesday that it expected to cut some 400 heavy-equipment operator positions over the next six years as it rolls out a fleet of self-driving trucks at its Canadian oil sand mining operations.\n",

      "The Calgary, Alberta-based company plans to deploy more than 150 driverless trucks and said it would start cutting jobs as soon as next year. It currently has nine autonomous trucks hauling material at its North Steepbank project in Alberta.\n",
      "The company said it planned to work with its labor union to find ways to mitigate the number of employees who lose their jobs, including training for other positions. Heavy-equipment operators will still be needed to work on other equipment.\n",
      "Suncor is the first Canadian oil sands company to introduce autonomous trucks, a technology that has been used in hard rock mines in other parts of the world. It began purchasing them in 2015, but has so far been operating them with drivers.\n",
      "Each mine will have its own control center to manage the 400-tonne vehicles, which have been programmed to operate in conditions unique to the oil sands, Chief Operating Officer Mark Little told Reuters.\n",
      "The trucks, which can run 24 hours a day while only stopping to add fuel, will enhance safety at the company's oil sand mines and reduce operating costs, Little said.\n",
      "He did not provide details on those savings or the cost of the truck fleet.\n",
      "Suncor had 12,837 employees at the end of 2016, including more than 6,000 people in its oil sands business unit.\n",

      "The recent accusations of sexual misconduct against a long list of powerful men in Hollywood and other industries have been widely believed — and led to resignations, loss of careers and other fallout.\n",
      "Meanwhile, some of the women who accused Donald Trump of sexual harassment or assault during the presidential campaign wonder when the president might finally pay a price for what he allegedly did to them.\n",
      "\"Things just seem to fall off of Trump, I'm extremely disappointed, \" says Jessica Leeds, 75, who alleges Trump tried to kiss her, fondle her breasts and put his hand up her skirt while on a flight to New York in the early 1980s.\n",
      "Their stories — like the harrowing one PEOPLE writer Natasha Stoynoff shared of Trump allegedly attacking her in 2005 by pushing her up against a wall at Mar-a- Lago and shoving his tongue down her throat — are backed up in most cases by co-workers, friends or family members.\n",
      "And then there is Trump's own words. In early October of last year came the infamous video showing Trump boasting to Billy Bush in 2005 of sexually assaulting women, that because he's a star he can \"grab them by the pussy.\" Days later, Trump denied he ever did those things during the second presidential debate and dismissed the comments as \"locker room talk.\"\n",
      "In the weeks that followed, many women alleged on the record that Trump had touched, grabbed or kissed them without their permission. Over the course of his campaign, more than 10 would come forward.\n",
      "\"I feel this issue has been 'on hold' all year, but not forgotten, \" says Stoynoff in an email. \"It's been simmering on the stove with the lid on, like a pressure cooker. But now the heat's on and it's going to boil and the lid is going to blast off.\"\n",
      "That blast off may come with help from a defamation lawsuit filed by Summer Zervos, a former Apprentice contestant who has alleged Trump began kissing her very aggressively and put his hand on her breast without her consent in 2007.\n",

      "CHICAGO (CBS) — Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan has fired a longtime political aide over allegations of sexual harassment.\n",
      "In a statement Monday morning, Madigan said his office was notified of the allegations against aide Kevin Quinn in November, and that he had his chief counsel conduct an investigation. Quinn is the brother of Ald. Marty Quinn (13th), a former Madigan campaign staffer.\n",
      "\"A courageous woman made me aware that a high-ranking individual within my political operation had previously made unwanted advances and sent her inappropriate text messages. I immediately consulted with my attorney, Heather Wier Vaught, and directed her to conduct a thorough investigation, \" Madigan said.\n",
      "According to Madigan's office, following a series of interviews, Wier Vaught \"recently came to the conclusion that the individual engaged in inappropriate conduct and failed to exercise the professional judgment I expect of those affiliated with my political organizations and the Office of the Speaker.\n",
      "\"As a result, long-time aide Kevin Quinn is no longer an employee of any of my political committees. Mr. Quinn has worked with my political offices for nearly 20 years. While this is the only allegation of such conduct, Mr. Quinn also recently pled guilty to misdemeanor disorderly conduct. Based on the culmination of events, Alderman Marty Quinn and I decided that Kevin should no longer be affiliated with the political organization. For the record, Kevin was previously an employee of my State office, and he will not be returning to that role, \" Madigan said.\n",
      "The speaker said his office also is implementing a number of recommendations Wier Vaught made to improve methods of reporting and responding to allegations of sexual misconduct.\n",

      "Former UMass Lowell security officers Timothy McLaughlin and Paulino Carteiro made those allegations, and others, in letters sent to the FBI and media, and in a lawsuit in Middlesex Superior Court, which alleges they were fired in retaliation for speaking out.\n",
      "And a judge recently allowed much of that lawsuit to proceed, after ruling against efforts to have it dismissed.\n",

      "A second federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending protections for Dreamers — undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. The ruling requires the Department of Homeland Security to continue accepting renewal applications for Dreamers protected by the Obama-era Deferred Action for Child Arrivals (DACA) program, which President Donald Trump moved to end last year.\n",
      "Tuesday's ruling from New York district court judge Nicholas Garaufis follows a similar preliminary injunction issued last month by California judge William Alsup. As Mother Jones has written, the Trump administration has taken the rare step of appealing Alsup's decision straight to the Supreme Court. But it has not sought not to immediately stop, or \"stay, \" the injunction. As a result, DACA renewals are likely to remain open for months, and possibly through the November midterm elections.\n",
      "Both district court rulings require DHS to accept applications from DACA recipients whose protections are expiring, as well as those whose two-year work permits have already expired. They do not require DHS to accept applications from people who have never been protected by DACA.\n",
      "Garaufis did not dispute that the Trump administration has the authority to end DACA. Instead, his decision holds that the administration likely violated a federal statute known as the Administrative Procedure Act by winding down DACA in an \"arbitrary and capricious\" manner. He concluded that a temporary injunction is necessary because ending DACA would likely cause \"irreparable harm\" to DACA recipients:\n",
      "If the decision is allowed to go into effect prior to a full adjudication on the merits, there is no way the court can \"unscramble the egg\" and undo the damage caused by what, on the record before it, appears to have been a patently arbitrary and capricious decision.\n",

      "The Affordable Care Act helped dramatically reduce the number of people who lack health coverage in New Jersey, but those who signed up are least satisfied with their coverage because of cost, according to a poll released Monday.\n",
      "People who bought their coverage through the Obamacare health exchange were the most likely to say cost drove their decision -- not because they liked the network of doctors or they wanted to maintain the same coverage from the prior year, according to the findings by the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling and the New Jersey Health Care Quality Institute.\n",
      "\"This group is the least satisfied about current costs and thus considers cost most when it comes to choosing a plan, \" said Ashley Koning, assistant research professor and director of the Eagleton Center at Rutgers University-New Brunswick. \"They are the only group to cite this as their top reason and do so by a 3-to-1 margin or more over every other demographic.\"\n",
      "But when all 1,203 people who participated in the poll were asked whether the health care and insurance systems were \"going in the wrong direction\" or were \"on the right track, \" 52 percent responded negatively, 37 positively and 12 percent said they did not know.\n",

      "U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona agrees with President Donald Trump on one thing: The state of the union is strong. But Gallego says it is in spite of the president, not because of him.\n",
      "In a characteristically sharp rebuke to the president's own annual assessment, the Arizona Democrat said Trump is a \"bad dealmaker\" whose policy flip-flops keep Congress from getting more done.\n",
      "\"The state of the union is strong, and it's not because of this president or any other past president, \" Gallego said in an interview with The Arizona Republic. \"The state of the union is always strong because our strength is found in everyday people going to work, raising their kids, trying to live the American dream.\n",
      "\"The question is as president, can you make it stronger? Can you make it better? Can you lay out the vision to do that? I don't think he knows how to do that, and I don't think he is presidential enough to do that.\"\n",
      "Gallego urged Trump to work more closely with Democrats if he's serious about passing legislation.\n",
      "\"The most important thing is that the president is realistic about how to pass legislation, considering the reality that his caucus is divided, is to work with us, \" Gallego said. \"There's a way for us to do that to pass the Dream Act, bring more border security, increase funding for our military and actually have a true infrastructure bill. ... The outcomes are better if he understands the reality that the Republican caucus can't govern.\"\n",
      "Gallego said Trump has seemingly sketched out positions on immigration and border security that could have served as the template for legislative deals, only to reject his own positions after consulting with his staff.\n",

The house is dilapidated. It was damaged by an electrical fire several years ago and has not been lived in since then. The plaster ceilings upstairs suffered damage when the roof leaked.\n",

After the fire, there was no electricity, and with no electricity, the sump pump did not work, said Carlotta DeFillo, who grew up in the house and whose son lived there until the fire. Fortunately, the house escaped damage when Hurricane Sandy churned across Staten Island in 2012.\n",

More than 22 million comments came in, but there have been so many serious irregularities with the process that Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel thinks the FCC needs to slam on the brakes. \"I've got concerns, \" Rosenworcel, who also served on FCC under President Obama and originally voted to instate the open internet order in 2015, said in an interview with Slate. \"There were some procedural problems with the way this all came together.\"\n",
      "For instance, she said, there have been allegations that most of the comments came from bots, or some even from dead people. Most of those fraudulent comments were suspiciously against net neutrality, while data analysts found the overwhelming majority of organic comments to be in favor of the internet regulations. In May, the FCC said that its comment system went down due to \"deliberate attempts by external actors to bombard the FCC's comment system with a high amount of traffic, \" an attack often referred to as a DDoS attack. Rosenworcel noted that the Government Accountability Office is now investigating that DDoS attack because the FCC's description of what happened raised\n",

      "Broadband companies that want to do business with state agencies in New York will have to abide by some key net neutrality rules, under an order signed Wednesday by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.\n",
      "The executive order, which takes effect March 1, specifically prohibits carriers that contract with state agencies from blocking, throttling or prioritizing content or applications, and from charging consumers \"different or higher rates to access specific types of content or applications.\"\n",
      "With the move, New York joins the state of Montana in using the power to enter into contracts as a mechanism to guarantee net neutrality.\n",
      "Cuomo's order comes six weeks after the Federal Communications Commission voted to repeal a set of net neutrality rules passed in 2015. Those rules also prohibited carriers from blocking or throttling material, and from charging higher fees for prioritized delivery.\n",
      "\"The FCC's dangerous ruling goes against the core values of our democracy, and New York will do everything in our power to protect net neutrality and the free exchange of ideas, \" Cuomo stated Wednesday. AT&T, Verizon and Frontier are among the carriers that reportedly currently have contracts with the state.\n",
      "When the FCC repealed the net neutrality rules, the agency also attempted to prohibit states from creating or enforcing their own version of net neutrality regulations.\n",
      "But it's not yet clear whether courts will uphold the FCC's recent order -- including the provision that blocks state laws. Already, 22 attorneys general, along with consumer groups and Mozilla, have challenged the FCC's order.\n",
      "Some observers say that the executive orders signed in Montana and New York may stand up against a challenge, even if courts uphold other portions of the FCC's recent move.\n",
      "Other states including California, Nebraska, Washington and Massachusetts are considering passing their own net neutrality legislation.\n",

As associate attorney general, Brand manages the lawyers who litigate civil rights, environmental and antitrust issues.\n",
      "Before Brand arrived, Attorney General Jeff Sessions had already sparked controversy with his actions on civil rights issues. He has begun to undo the Justice Department's policy toward transgender students in public schools; unsuccessfully tried to pull back from a sweeping reform agreement the department has with the Baltimore Police Department; ordered officials to review other reform agreements with troubled police forces nationwide; and reversed the Justice Department's position on a voting rights law in Texas that a federal court has found intentionally discriminatory.\n",

      "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is on track to expand at a 3.3 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 following December data on domestic retail sales and consumer prices, the Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow forecast model showed on Friday.\n",

      "Earlier Friday, the government said the core rate on the Consumer Price Index, which is seen as a proxy on underlying inflation trend, grew 0.3 percent in December, which was its steepest monthly increase in 11 months. This brought its year-over-year gain to 1.8 percent.\n",

      "In an effort to combat the problem of opioid addiction and overdoses, Assemblyman Freddie Rodriguez, D-Pomona, has introduced legislation to restrict the ability of doctors to prescribe opioids for more than 3 days at a time. Under the proposal, patients could refill their prescriptions at a pharmacy up to three times, but on the fourth refill, the doctor would have to explain why additional medication is needed.\n",
      "It's one of those proposals that superficially sounds like it could really help. If one believes that opioids are highly addictive and that more opioids being prescribed means more people will become addicted and that many will end up dying, then it makes sense that cutting down on opioid prescriptions could save lives.\n",
      "As appealing as that line of thinking seems, a look at the relationship between opioid prescriptions and overdose deaths reveals that government efforts to cut the supply of opioids is itself a major driver of the opioid overdose problem in the first place, not a solution.\n",
      "It's a simple, and tragic, example of the unintended consequences of well-intentioned but shortsighted policy making.\n",
      "While nationwide opioid prescriptions declined 18 percent between 2010 and 2015, the rate of overdoses sharply increased from 12.3 per 100,000 population in 2010 to 16.3 in 2015.\n",
      "The decrease in prescriptions was driven by efforts of the Obama administration, the Office of National Drug Control, the Drug Enforcement Administration and several state governments to reduce opioid misuse and perceived over-prescribing through greater enforcement, stricter rules and prosecutions of doctors and pharmacists, according to the Drug Policy Alliance.\n",

      "BUFFALO, N.Y. — Scientists studying addiction know that heroin and other opioids induce plasticity in brain cells. Now, University at Buffalo researchers have made the novel discovery that in certain types of brain cells, drug-induced plasticity can work to reduce, rather than boost, motivation for heroin.\n",
      "\"Most therapies have focused on the blocking or activating of receptors that bind drugs like heroin, \" explained David Dietz, PhD, senior author of the paper and associate professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB. \"While that approach may be effective in the short-term, it doesn't get to the fundamental problem of what is addiction and how to prevent it, as well as prevent relapse.\"\n",
      "\"Not much is known about glial cells in the context of addiction\" said Dietz, a faculty member with UB's neuroscience program. \"In the addiction field, most neuroscientists focus on neurons. Very rarely have they studied glial cells in psychiatric diseases. This work demonstrates an essential role of glia in addictive behaviors, and offers us the ability to provide a new set of targets for future therapies toward the treatment of addiction.\"\n",
      "Dietz and his colleagues decided to study the potential role of glial cells in addiction when they found that RNA sequencing of tissue from heroin-addicted animals revealed changes in genes that are traditionally markers for a type of glial stem cell called oligodendrocyte precursor cells or OPCs.\n",

      "A pump failure over the weekend caused 880 barrels, or 36,960 gallons, of brine to spill Sunday at a saltwater disposal well in Bottineau County, the state Oil and Gas Division said.\n",
      "The spill was contained within the dike of the Rice-State 2H well about 8 miles east of Mohall, the agency said. All but two barrels, or 84 gallons, have been cleaned up, officials said.\n",
      "The spill occurred as 31 Operating was taking over ownership of the well from Petro Harvester.\n",
      "Alison Ritter, spokeswoman for the Oil and Gas Division, said the spill occurred on Sunday and 31 Operating reported it on Monday. The transfer of the well was expected to be complete on Tuesday, Ritter said.\n",

      "Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice, leaves court after a hearing in her defamation case against President Trump on December 5. Andrew Kelly / Reuters\n",
      "It's been two months since the reckoning began. In early October, The New York Times and The New Yorker first published the alarming accounts of women who said they'd been assaulted by Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. Rare is the day since then that women, and some men, haven't come forward with accounts of sexual misconduct from famous and not-so-famous men alike.\n",
      "Trump's Risky, Unearned Sanctimony About Al Franken\n",
      "Lurking in the background of the roiling debate about harassment and assault in American society are the allegations made against President Trump by at least 19 women, many of whom came forward after the release of the Access Hollywood tape in October 2016. Trump vociferously denies any wrongdoing. \"Is the official White House position that all of these women are lying?\" a reporter asked Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, in late October. \"Yeah, we've been clear on that from the beginning, and the president's spoken on it, \" Sanders replied.\n",
      "Some of the women's stories date back to the 1980s when Trump's personal relationships were fixtures of the New York City tabloids; others begin after he returned to the public eye with his NBC series The Apprentice. Their accounts describe a wide range of alleged behavior, including lewd remarks, overt harassment, groping, and sexual assault. One woman, Summer Zervos, is currently suing the president for defamation after he repeatedly called her and the others liars.

      "Last week, babe.net published an anonymous woman's account of her date with actor/comedian Aziz Ansari, who she says pressured her into uncomfortable and unwanted sex, failing to heed her \"verbal and non-verbal cues.\"\n",
      "In response, the internet has produced wave after wave of takes. The Atlantic's Caitlin Flanagan said the article was \"3,000 words of revenge porn\" and unfit for publication. Vox's Anna North characterized Ansari's behavior as common among all-too-many men, and thus worth discussing. The New York Times's Bari Weiss wrote that if Ansari was guilty of anything, it was \"not being a mind reader, \" and fretted that this incident could tarnish the #MeToo movement. Reason's own Elizabeth Nolan Brown thought both parties — as well as men and women in general — could benefit from more communication about sexual desires.\n",
      "These are wildly different takes, and there are dozens more perspectives offered in The Washington Post, National Review, Jezebel, on Twitter, and elsewhere. But most of the takes have one thing in common: they explicitly reject the original article's assertion that Aziz Ansari committed sexual assault. Ansari behaved badly, and there is much to be said about how he ignored his date's wishes, thought only of himself, and expected sexual gratification at every turn. But he is not a rapist, most people seem to agree.\n",
      "And yet, boorish behavior similar to Ansari's — behavior that most pundits say they consider gross but not criminal, at least in Ansari's case — is routinely investigated as sexual misconduct on university campuses. Ansari is lucky he's not a college student; otherwise he could have been accused months or a year after the incident, investigated by a lone administrator with sole power to decide which witnesses to interview, called before a hearing to answer charges he does not fully understand, forbidden from consulting a lawyer or cross-examining his accuser, found responsible for sexual misconduct under a preponderance of the evidenc\n",

      "She watched her son leave for high school, flipped on the flat screen and then, Alecia McNair waited. Most days, her habit was to listen absent-mindedly to \"CBS This Morning\" as she prepared for another day as a 53-year-old single mother. But this past fall, it seemed that every time she turned on the news, there was another story about a man who had abused his power, a woman who had finally spoken up, and — this was the part that McNair could hardly believe — an apology.\n",
      "\"And that was something I feel that I never got, \" she says. She was like so many women, carrying around an experience that she had never really talked about, that she blamed herself for, that she had been determined to leave in the past. But now? It seemed like something was changing. McNair, who asked to be identified by her middle name, no longer worked at the company in Georgia where she says she was harassed. But maybe, she thought, she owed it to the women who were still there to speak up.\n",
      "For the first time, she called an attorney — she made sure to choose a woman — and told her everything. About his comments. His pornographic pictures. His touching.\n",
      "Amanda Farahany listened carefully, taking notes on everything that would indicate McNair's employer had known that the man was predatory, but had done nothing. It sounded as if she might have a case.\n",
      "Then Farahany asked McNair when all this had taken place. In Georgia, the statute of limitations for filing a workplace discrimination claim is 180 days.\n",
      "\"About two years ago, \" McNair answered.\n",
      "Farahany braced herself to say what employment attorneys across the country have found themselves reluctantly repeating more and more since the #MeToo movement began.\n",

      "The business editor of the Los Angeles Times made a triumphant return to the newsroom to applause Thursday after several days away, telling colleagues she had been whisked away and suspended as part of the newspaper's investigation into the leak of taped remarks made by the paper's editor-in-chief in November.\n",
      "According to several staffers, Business Editor Kimi Yoshino told members of the LA Times business desk that the then editor-in-chief, Lewis D'Vorkin, personally walked her to human resources offices last week. Yoshino said she was then grilled over a conversation she had with New York Times reporter Sydney Ember in advance of a story published in that paper.\n",
      "That story revealed that reporters clashed with D'Vorkin at a November newsroom meeting over his handling of the Walt Disney Co.'s condemnations of the LA Times for its coverage of financial breaks given by the City of Anaheim to the entertainment giant. D'Vorkin had not publicly defended the LA Times' reporting even as Disney blocked LA Times reporters and critics from advance screenings of its films, inhibiting cultural coverage and movie reviews. The company lifted the ban after a meeting with D'Vorkin and LA Times Publisher Ross Levinsohn.\n",
      "Yoshino denied sharing any audio with the New York Times reporter, telling colleagues she simply had an innocuous conversation with Ember shortly before the story.\n",
      "The leak of the staff meeting and the subsequent story in the rival New York Times incensed D'Vorkin and LA Times Publisher Ross Levinsohn, who called New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet to complain, according to a spokeswoman for the New York paper. (Levinsohn did not respond to requests for comment.)\n",

      "One of Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ)'s last major votes before retirement could be a death sentence for tens of thousands of Americans. One of them is Ady Barkan, a 33-year-old California father living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), who, during a Thursday night flight from Washington D.C. to Phoenix, Arizona, asked Flake to cast a vote to save his life.\n",
      "\"I was healthy a year ago. I was running on the beach, \" Barkan told Flake on the flight, according to video footage of the exchange. \"I'm 33, I have an 18-month-old son, and out of nowhere I was diagnosed with ALS, which has a life expectancy of three to four years, no treatment, no cure.\"\n",
      "Due to his ALS, Barkan will probably need the assistance of a ventilator to stay alive long enough to see his son grow up. But the Republican tax bill, which recently passed the Senate, could result in major cuts to disability funding that will be necessary for Barkan to afford the medical assistance he'll need as the disease progresses.\n",
      "That's because the GOP tax bill could potentially result in $150 billion a year in automatic cuts to safety net programs, including Medicare, student loans, farm subsidies, and support services for crime victims. These cuts may be triggered by the congressional \"pay-as-you-go\" (PAYGO) rule, which requires Congress to offset the cost of any legislation or trigger cuts to federal programs.\n",
      "If those cuts — including a $25 billion per year cut to Medicaid — go into effect, Barkan says he would not be able to afford a ventilator.\n",
      "\"Mick Mulvaney of the Office of Management and Budget is individually responsible for choosing and implementing those cuts, \" Barkan said during his conversation with Flake. \"He thinks people on disability are just slackers, so what happens? What should I tell my son or what should you tell my son if you pass this bill and he cuts funding for disability and I can't get a ventilator?\"\n",

      "This story has been updated to reflect the more specific location of where the photographs were taken.\n",
      "When photographer Paul Nicklen and filmmakers from conservation group Sea Legacy arrived on Somerset Islanda\"near the larger Baffin Islanda\"in late summer, they came across a heartbreaking sight: a starving polar bear on its deathbed.\n",
      "Nicklen is no stranger to bears. From the time he was a child growing up in Canada's far north the biologist turned wildlife photographer has seen over 3,000 bears in the wild. But the emaciated polar bear, featured in videos Nicklen published to social media on December 5, was one of the most gut-wrenching sights he's ever seen.\n",
      "\"We stood there cryinga\"filming with tears rolling down our cheeks, \" he said.\n",
      "Video shows the polar bear clinging to life, its white hair limply covering its thin, bony frame. One of the bear's back legs drags behind it as it walks, likely due to muscle atrophy. Looking for food, the polar bear slowly rummages through a nearby trashcan used seasonally by Inuit fishers. It finds nothing and resignedly collapses back down onto the ground.\n",
      "In the days since Nicklen posted the footage, he's been asked why he didnat intervene.\n",
      "\"Of course, that crossed my mind, \" said Nicklen. \"But it's not like I walk around with a tranquilizer gun or 400 pounds of seal meat.\"\n",
      "And even if he did, said Nicklen, he only would have been prolonging the bear's misery. Plus, feeding wild polar bears is illegal in Canada.\n",
      "The wildlife photographer says he filmed the bear's slow, beleaguered death because he didn't want it to die in vain.\n",
      "\"When scientists say bears are going extinct, I want people to realize what it looks like. Bears are going to starve to death, \" said Nicklen. \"This is what a starving bear looks like.\"\n",

      "Earth's magnetic poles may be getting ready to flip\n",
      "So, geophysicists have been studying the earth's magnetic field, and they think it's getting ready to \"flip\" -- with the north and south poles changing places.\n",
      "This has happened a few hundred times in the planet's history, most recently 780,000 years ago. The poles tried to swap places much more recently, 40,000 years ago, but snapped back into place.\n",
      "The magnetic field is understood to be created by the flows of liquid metal in our planet's core. After studying satellite data, geophysicists now believe that \"swirling clusters of molten iron and nickel\" are an early sign of an impending pole-flip.\n",
      "If it happens, when would it take place? N😲ne knows.\n",
      "But it'll be a nightmare! As science journalist Alanna Mitchell explains in this Undark excerpt from her book The Spinning Magnet ...\n",
      "The Earth's magnetic field protects our planet from dangerous solar and cosmic rays, like a giant shield. As the poles switch places (or try to), that shield is weakened; scientists estimate that it could waste away to as little as a tenth of its usual force. The shield could be compromised for centuries while the poles move, allowing malevolent radiation closer to the surface of the planet for that whole time. Already, changes within the Earth have weakened the field over the South Atlantic so much that satellites exposed to the resulting radiation have experienced memory failure. That radiation isn't hitting the surface yet. But at some point, when the magnetic field has dwindled enough, it could be a different story. Daniel Baker, director of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado, Boulder, one of the world's experts on how cosmic radiation affects the Earth, fears that parts of the planet will become uninhabitable during a reversal. The dangers: devastating streams of particles from the sun, galactic cosmic rays, and enhanced ultraviolet B rays from a radiation-damaged ozone layer, to name just \n"

      "It didn't take long to identify the male insect as a pleasing lacewing by its photograph taken July 15. But Preney and his friend Russ Jones only recently got the documented discovery published in the Journal of the Entomological Society of Ontario.\n",
      "Jones, a biologist who has known Preney since they were boys searching for bugs and snakes, took the photograph that helped identify the insect family and species that had never been seen and documented in Canada.\n",
      "This pleasing lacewing species is the only one found in eastern North America. They likely have been in the area for years but no one had identified one.\n",
      "\"It's never been seen in Canada before ... It's pretty cool, \" Jones said of the rare discovery of a new family of insects for Canada.\n",
      "Not much is known about the pleasing lacewing that was found near the Spring Garden Natural Area between Huron Church and Malden roads. The delicate-looking insect has translucent wings, is less than a centimetre wide, and looks like a small moth at first glance. Preney said it has tiny hairs on the outer edges of its wings and feather-like antennae.\n",

      "As far as we can tell, the formula of new science, new technology and a familiar old face has brought its own form of sheer joy.\n",
      "The series is hosted and narrated by the now 91-year-old Attenborough, the British naturalist who just about invented this line of work, and who has seen it change.\n",
      "\"Audiences wanted -- or were perceived by network controllers to want -- something that was always cuddly or something that was not too serious, \" he told Phillips. \"But that's changed.\"\n",
      "In the old days (his first major series ran in 1979), if the audience wanted cuddly, Attenborough gave it to them, such as the cuddling gorillas.\n",

The ruling requires the Department of Homeland Security to continue accepting renewal applications for Dreamers protected by the Obama-era Deferred Action for Child Arrivals (DACA) program, which President Donald Trump moved to end last year.\n",
      "Tuesday's ruling from New York district court judge Nicholas Garaufis follows a similar preliminary injunction issued last month by California judge William Alsup. As Mother Jones has written, the Trump administration has taken the rare step of appealing Alsup's decision straight to the Supreme Court. But it has not sought not to immediately stop, or \"stay, \" the injunction. As a result, DACA renewals are likely to remain open for months, and possibly through the November midterm elections.\n",
      "Both district court rulings require DHS to accept applications from DACA recipients whose protections are expiring, as well as those whose two-year work permits have already expired. They do not require DHS to accept applications from people who have never been protected by DACA.\n",
      "Garaufis did not dispute that the Trump administration has the authority to end DACA. Instead, his decision holds that the administration likely violated a federal statute known as the Administrative Procedure Act by winding down DACA in an \"arbitrary and capricious\" manner. He concluded that a temporary injunction is necessary because ending DACA would likely cause \"irreparable harm\" to DACA recipients:\n",
      "If the decision is allowed to go into effect prior to a full adjudication on the merits, there is no way the court can \"unscramble the egg\" and undo the damage caused by what, on the record before it, appears to have been a patently arbitrary and capricious decision.\n"

      "The Department of Homeland Security says, however, that it is merely re-working the administration's efforts, and promises more effective measures to come.\n",
      "While the motives remain unknown in Sunday night's Law Vegas shooting that killed at least 59 people and injured more than 500, the event immediately raised questions about domestic terrorism and whether it is a case of homegrown extremism.\n",
      "President Donald Trump's 2018 budget proposal included steep cuts to a number of grant programs run by the Department of Homeland Security that go toward terrorism and violent extremism preparedness and prevention. All told, more than $300 million is slated to be cut from such programs.\n",
      "The administration has also folded two counterterror grant programs altogether, and is in the process of rebranding the Obama administration's Countering Violent Extremism office.\n",
      "A senior DHS official disputed the notion that the administration was retreating from the effort, though, saying a new strategy is forthcoming.\n",
      "\"We really intend to elevate and amplify our terrorism prevention efforts in a big way, because the threat environment is serious, we're taking it seriously and we're doing a full end-to-end review of what we do on terrorism prevention to make sure that our efforts are effective, \" the official told CNN. \"We do not intend to focus our terrorism prevention efforts exclusively on one ideology. DHS is committed to combating both domestic terrorism and international terrorism and bolstering efforts for both.\"\n",
      "Nevertheless, DHS officials have faced numerous questions from lawmakers about the proposed cuts to the programs and criticism from counterterror experts. The House-passed 2018 budget, which still needs\n",

      "Medicaid Family Planning Policy\n",
      "The manner in which family planning services are financed and organized is unique within the Medicaid program. All state Medicaid programs must offer some level of family planning benefits, and health care providers and pharmacies are not permitted to charge cost-sharing for family planning services. In most cases, beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid managed care networks may obtain family planning services from the provider of their choice (as long as the provider participates in the Medicaid program) even if they are not considered \"in-network\" providers. The federal government matches state family planning contributions to all participating providers at 90%, which is generally a higher rate than that offered for other services. This payment policy has been an incentive in state efforts to expand coverage for family planning services to individuals who have not been otherwise eligible for full scope Medicaid coverage.\n",
      "Family planning is classified as a \"mandatory\" benefit under Medicaid, meaning that all programs must cover family planning, but states have considerable discretion in identifying the specific services and supplies that are included in the program. There is no formal definition of family planning in the Medicaid program. Rather, federal law generally allows payment for \"family planning services and supplies furnished (directly or under arrangements with others) to individuals of child-bearing age (including minors who can be considered to be sexually active) who are eligible under the State plan and who desire such services and supplies.\" Contraception is one of the primary services included as family planning, and most states offer broad coverage for prescription contraceptives in their Medicaid programs.\n",
      "Over time, the clinical context of family planning has evolved to include a broader array of services, such as health education and promotion, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, and services th\n",

      "The 2019 federal budget proposed by President Donald Trump calls for a 34 percent cut to the Environmental Protection Agency, cutting funding for the agency to $5.4 billion — its lowest funding level since 1990.\n",
      "Trump's proposed budget is very unlikely to become law, but it does set out the administration's agenda. The budget calls for more spending on defense and border security with cuts to entitlements and other domestic spending.\n",
      "It's not clear how many employees the EPA would have at the proposed funding level. In his 2018 proposal, Trump called for cutting the EPA's budget to $5.6 billion and 11,611 full-time positions. Congress has yet to pass a budget for the current fiscal year, which began last October, instead relying on short-term deals to keep the government funded. It is currently funded through March 23.\n",
      "Already, a wave of buyouts and retirements have reduced the agency's ranks. It had 14,188 full-time employees in December , its fewest employees since 1987, according to the EPA . The agency received $8.2 billion in funding in the 2017 enacted budget. There are more than 1,000 federal employees at EPA offices in North Carolina. The EPA's office in Research Triangle Park , at 1.2 million square feet the largest the agency has ever built, includes 15 offices, including the agency's center for air pollution research and regulation.\n",

      "Meet Mimi Lemay, an amazing Mom, trans youth advocate, and someone I'm proud to know through the wonders of technology. Mimi did this MSNBC interview in May, 2016, after the Obama era guidance was issued regarding transgender students in public schools. That guidance clarified how to best support transgender students in schools across the nation, in light of more trans students being \"out.\" Under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, schools receiving federal money may not discriminate based on a student's sex, including a student's transgender status. The U.S. Departments of Education and Justice released in 2016, under President Obama, joint guidance to help provide educators with the information they needed to ensure that all students could attend school in an environment free from sex discrimination, and that in no uncertain terms included transgender students.\n",
      "During Mimi's interview, we see a replay of a guy speaking from an earlier interview. He says that gender identity is a \"new concept\" (it isn't), he indicates that he does not want LGBTQ+ people to have basic rights, and he raises concerns about the safety of others with regard to sexual assault. The implication is that trans folks — or people \"pretending\" to be trans — will commit acts of sexual harassment/assault in public restrooms, and therefore, should not be legally permitted to use the public restrooms/locker rooms/changing facilities that match the gender they identify as. This \"bathroom bill\" language is rather old news, but if you missed it, or just want to hear those points ad nauseam, here's the interview in question.\n",

      "On the 89th birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., we reach back to Dr. King's teachings for inspiration in these extraordinary times. We search for the light to drive out the darkness and hope for the ideals of our nation to prevail.\n",
      "In front of 20,000 people who had marched for equality, and during a time of crushing poverty and racist laws and policies affecting many African-Americans, Dr. King famously asked in 1965: \"How long will it take?\" And then he answered his own question, paraphrasing abolitionist Theodore Parker: \"Not long, because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\"\n",
      "The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. speaking. (Photo by Julian Wasser/Getty Images)\n",
      "Dr. King believed in the collective power of individual action, that it could propel us forward along the arc toward equality. And that the systemic inequality at the core of America did not afford anyone the option of standing idly by.\n",
      "These words and teachings have held a special significance over the past year. There are many reminders that this is far from a normal chapter in our country's history. Hate crimes are on the rise; marginalized communities are threatened; cruel and discriminatory federal policies threaten to undermine our progress and the values of our country; and racist rhetoric literally flows from the highest levels of power.\n",

It has rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, leaving the lives of hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants hanging in the balance.

      "Historians have long looked to a few key criteria in evaluating the beginning of a president's administration. First and foremost, any new president should execute public duties with a commanding civility and poise befitting the nation's chief executive, but without appearing aloof or haughty. As George Washington observed at the outset of his presidency in 1789, the president cannot in any way \"demean himself in his public character\" and must act \"in such a manner as to maintain the dignity of office.\"\n",
      "New presidents also try to avoid partisan and factional rancor, and endeavor to unite the country in a great common purpose. In line with their oath of office, they dedicate themselves to safeguarding and even advancing democratic rights and to protecting the nation against foreign enemies. They avoid even the slightest imputation of corruption, of course political but above all financial.\n",
      "Donald Trump, in each area, has been a colossal failure. The truest measure of his performance comes from comparing his first year not with those of the best — Washington, Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt — but with those of the worst.\n",

      "Andrew and Elad Dvash-Banks' trip to the United States consulate in Toronto should've been a brief one. The married couple had twins while living in Canada, and Canadian law recognized the two men as their children's sole parents. Andrew is an American citizen while Elad is Israeli, but under U.S. law, children born abroad with one American parent become citizens at birth. Both children should've promptly received citizenship.\n",
      "Instead, a consular official demanded to know which spouse provided sperm for which child. The couple reluctantly disclosed that one child, Ethan, was conceived with Elad's sperm, while the other, Aiden, was conceived with Andrew's. The children shared an anonymous egg donor and were born via surrogacy just minutes apart. The official told Andrew and Elad that only Aiden could receive U.S. citizenship — and even then, only after a DNA test. Ethan, she asserted, did not qualify as an American.\n",
      "This week, the legal advocacy group Immigration Equality filed suit against the U.S. government on behalf of the Dvash-Banks family as well as a binational lesbian couple facing the same roadblock. Immigration Equality argues the government's policy violates the Dvash-Banks' constitutional rights. It's almost certainly correct.\n",
      "The constitutional problems here are not subtle. In a trio of decisions, the Supreme Court has articulated clear protections for same-sex couples and their children. In accordance with due process and equal protection, the government may not \"degrade or demean\" gay couples on account of their orientation. It must recognize their marriages \"on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples.\" It may not \"stigmatize\" these couples or infringe their right to \"equal dignity.\" And, critically, it must provide them with \"the constellation of benefits\" linked to marriage, including equal legal treatment of their children.\n",

      "(Reuters) - Suncor Energy Inc said on Wednesday that it expected to cut some 400 heavy-equipment operator positions over the next six years as it rolls out a fleet of self-driving trucks at its Canadian oil sand mining operations.\n",

      "The Calgary, Alberta-based company plans to deploy more than 150 driverless trucks and said it would start cutting jobs as soon as next year. It currently has nine autonomous trucks hauling material at its North Steepbank project in Alberta.\n",
      "The company said it planned to work with its labor union to find ways to mitigate the number of employees who lose their jobs, including training for other positions. Heavy-equipment operators will still be needed to work on other equipment.\n",
      "Suncor is the first Canadian oil sands company to introduce autonomous trucks, a technology that has been used in hard rock mines in other parts of the world. It began purchasing them in 2015, but has so far been operating them with drivers.\n",
      "Each mine will have its own control center to manage the 400-tonne vehicles, which have been programmed to operate in conditions unique to the oil sands, Chief Operating Officer Mark Little told Reuters.\n",
      "The trucks, which can run 24 hours a day while only stopping to add fuel, will enhance safety at the company's oil sand mines and reduce operating costs, Little said.\n",
      "He did not provide details on those savings or the cost of the truck fleet.\n",
      "Suncor had 12,837 employees at the end of 2016, including more than 6,000 people in its oil sands business unit.\n",

      "Policy analysts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta were told of the list of forbidden words at a meeting Thursday with senior CDC officials who oversee the budget, according to an analyst who took part in the 90-minute briefing. The forbidden words are \"vulnerable, \" \"entitlement, \" \"diversity, \" \"transgender, \" \"fetus, \" \"evidence-based\" and \"science-based.\"\n",

      "Meet Mimi Lemay, an amazing Mom, trans youth advocate, and someone I'm proud to know through the wonders of technology. Mimi did this MSNBC interview in May, 2016, after the Obama era guidance was issued regarding transgender students in public schools. That guidance clarified how to best support transgender students in schools across the nation, in light of more trans students being \"out.\" Under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, schools receiving federal money may not discriminate based on a student's sex, including a student's transgender status. The U.S. Departments of Education and Justice released in 2016, under President Obama, joint guidance to help provide educators with the information they needed to ensure that all students could attend school in an environment free from sex discrimination, and that in no uncertain terms included transgender students.\n",
      "During Mimi's interview, we see a replay of a guy speaking from an earlier interview. He says that gender identity is a \"new concept\" (it isn't), he indicates that he does not want LGBTQ+ people to have basic rights, and he raises concerns about the safety of others with regard to sexual assault. The implication is that trans folks — or people \"pretending\" to be trans — will commit acts of sexual harassment/assault in public restrooms, and therefore, should not be legally permitted to use the public restrooms/locker rooms/changing facilities that match the gender they identify as. This \"bathroom bill\" language is rather old news, but if you missed it, or just want to hear those points ad nauseam, here's the interview in question.\n",

      "Williams College is one of at least 100 campuses with a system in place for students to report each other for saying or doing something slightly offensive. These trivially disturbing occurrences are known as \"bias incidents\" — and at Williams, virtually anything could qualify.\n",
      "According to the Massachusetts college's website, \"name-calling and stereotyping\" are examples of bias. Telling a joke that draws its humor from a stereotype is also wrong. Students shouldn't use slurs, or the word \"gay\" as an insult, or display \"a sign that is color­coded pink for girls and blue for boys, \" or imitate someone's \"cultural norm or practice.\"\n",

      "Mocking someone's disability on Twitter would be awful. \"Making comments on social media\" about another person's religious or political beliefs isn't remotely similar.

Pruitt certainly seems to feel the animosity, even within his agency. Definers Public Affairs, a Republican opposition research firm, was hired to monitor the email accounts of EPA employees critical of him.\n",
      "\"The mood here is morbid, \" says Nate James, an information technology specialist at EPA headquarters in Washington, D.C., as well as the chapter head of American Federation of Government Employees, the union that represents EPA workers. \"There is an element of fear.\"\n",
      "John O'Grady, an engineer in the Chicago regional office of the EPA, says Pruitt \"does not meet with the staff\" and generally behaves like a \"mystery guest\" within the agency. Last summer, Pruitt had his spacious office outfitted with a secure communication booth costing nearly $25,000. This was a practice common among intelligence agency chiefs, not EPA administrators. It suggested grandiosity, ambition and more than a little paranoia. Previous to that, he devoted $9,000 of taxpayer money to the installation of biometric locks and ordered an inspection of his office for listening devices. He travels with a security detail of more than a dozen high-ranking EPA officials who are supposed to be investigating environmental crimes. They are instead guarding Pruitt.\n",
      "All this makes it easy to caricature Pruitt as a zealous anti-environmentalist, even as his associates insist his approach is guided by both principle and faith. Political ambition plainly guides Pruitt as well. In his first three months at the agency, Pruitt spent 43 days in Oklahoma, flying there at taxpayers' expense, but not on taxpayers' business. Instead, his meetings there, with energy concerns and ranchers, looked like the beginnings of a political campaign.

      "The Trump administration Tuesday formally announced it will end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program — also called DACA — putting an expiration date on the legal protections granted to roughly 800,000 people known as \"DREAMers, \" who entered the country illegally as children.\n",
      "President Trump issued a statement, saying, \"I do not favor punishing children, most of whom are now adults, for the actions of their parents. But we must also recognize that we are nation of opportunity because we are a nation of laws.\"\n",
      "He also said he looks forward to working with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to address immigration issues \"in a manner that puts the hardworking citizens of our country first.\"\n",
      "White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump \"wrestled\" with the decision to end DACA over the weekend. In an afternoon briefing, she denied the decision was \"coldhearted, \" painting it as the alternative to an immediate shutdown of the program by a federal court. She said the president wants DACA made permanent as part of \"comprehensive\" immigration legislation that would end illegal immigration, prevent visa overstays and create a \"merit based\" system of immigration.\n",
      "Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a longtime opponent of the policy, made the formal announcement Tuesday morning. He called DACA \"unilateral executive amnesty\" and said the Obama administration \"deliberately sought to achieve what the legislative branch specifically refused to authorize on multiple occasions. Such an open-ended circumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the executive branch.\" He said DACA \"denied jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allowing those same illegal aliens to take those jobs.\"\n",

      "The proposal, titled \"Efficient, Effective, Accountable: An American Budget, \" sets forth President Trump's priorities as Congress prepares to consider spending bills for the next fiscal year.\n",

      "But even with these reductions, which add up to more than $3 trillion in cuts over 10 years, the proposal would not bring the budget into balance because of the lost tax revenue and higher spending on other programs.\n",

      "If you search for \"Julien Baker\" on YouTube, you will quickly find yourself in a corner of the Internet that feels as quiet and cool as a medieval cloister, where a young woman sings folk canticles alone, with her eyes closed. That Baker always sings like she is trying to bounce her voice off the walls of a cathedral is intentional: she believes in God, says she has \"encountered the tangible manifestation of God, \" and says that she tries to leave space for God to enter the room whenever she opens up her throat. In the months since her debut album, \"Sprained Ankle, \" was released, last October, a kind of digital cottage industry has sprung up around the twenty-year-old singer; it involves putting Baker in a space — any space — alone with her guitar and filming what happens. There are videos online of her singing in a library, in a fluorescent parking garage, on top of crumbling stadium bleachers, in an empty dive bar. All of these quotidian places become temporarily sacrosanct when Baker is performing in them; the raw purity of her vocalise seems to convert the everyday into the divine. With Baker in the frame, any parking lot can revert into a paradise.\n",
      "Baker, who is currently on a tour through the U.S. and Europe (she played New York's Bowery Ballroom this week, and will play the festival circuit this summer), also turns concert venues into sacred spaces. When she is onstage, the audience goes hushed, reverential. The only sounds you hear between songs are her fingers as she tweaks the tuning on her electric guitar, scattered whispers between friends, and the rustling as the crowd waits patiently for Baker to start strumming again. She never asks for this quiet from the pit, it just seems to coalesce around her. Baker herself is shy, squeaky, small of stature — an introverted pip in plaid shirts with a Memphis twang and a nervous stutter. But her music seems to demand a certain kind of pin-drop attention the moment she starts to shake her voice loose, flinging it \n"

      "Forty years ago, on Jan. 28, 1978, an entire generation was educated about the evils of concert bootlegging in a two-part Very Special Episode of What's Happening!! guest-starring the Doobie Brothers. The show, titled \"Doobie or Not Doobie, \" made such an impact, in fact, that it later inspired its own Facebook page, \"That Episode of What's Happening!! Where Rerun Bootlegs the Doobie Brothers.\" And the band's founding member Patrick Simmons is still frequently greeted with the What's Happening!! catchphrase \"Which Doobie you be?\"\n",
      "\"All the time. I always laugh, \" Simmons tells Yahoo Entertainment. \"That's one of those things that when people forget what the hell the Doobie Brothers ever did musically, they'll remember that we were on What's Happening!!\"\n",
      "Of course, in retrospect, there were many suspension-of-disbelief moments in this two-parter's storyline, and many questions that went unanswered. For instance, why were the Doobies playing a tiny Watts high school auditorium in the first place — were they really all campus alumni, as the sitcom's script claimed? Is that much dry-ice smoke even allowed in school auditoriums? When brainy student Raj interviewed the band for his school newspaper, how did he not know any of the members' names, even though he repeatedly noted that the Doobies were his \"favorite rock group\"? And why did the band take such a shine to Raj's bratty little sister, Dee, even though she made every effort to sabotage Raj's interview with her snarky insults?\n",
      "And ... most important ... why did beret-topped, pop-locking student Rerun, who'd been bullied by local gangsters into this bootlegging scam, strap an encyclopedia-sized reel-to-reel tape recorder to his trench-coated torso to do the job? And how, when that recorder came loose due to Rerun's overenthusiastic dancing to \"Takin' It to the Streets\" and fell to the floor, did not only every single onstage Doobie Brother stop and notice, but even concertgoers in the back rows witnessed the incident\n",

      "DNR appeals to reinstate high-capacity pumping from vulnerable aquifers\n",
      "The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has gone to court to reinstate high-capacity well permits that its own experts said would harm vulnerable lakes, streams and drinking water.\n",
      "The DNR has filed with the state Court of Appeals District 2 in Waukesha to overturn Dane County Circuit Judge Valerie Bailey-Rihn's ruling in October throwing out eight industrial well permits granted to businesses by the DNR.\n",
      "Bailey-Rihn ruled that the permits ran afoul of a constitutional provision requiring state government to protect water for the public.\n",
      "She was ruling in a lawsuit the conservation group Clean Wisconsin filed in 2016 after examining permits the DNR issued after a policy change it made that year after state Attorney General Brad Schimel said the department had overstepped its authority.\n",
      "Large farms, food processors and Republicans who control state government had been frustrated about pumping limits the DNR was imposing.\n",
      "A legislative committee's request prompted Schimel to issue his opinion that a 2011 law limiting the power of state agencies trumped court rulings that had led to the pumping limits.\n",
      "The DNR had been limiting pumping when it determined that a new well combined with other high-capacity wells in an area would substantially harm wetlands, stream flows, groundwater, and ecology of the surrounding landscape.\n",
      "However, the Legislature has never specifically authorized the department to consider the cumulative impact of all wells affecting a given area.\n",
      "The DNR changed its policy and within months approved 190 high-capacity well applications that had been held up because businesses were unhappy with proposed pumping limits.\n",
      "The agency also relaxed limits it previously placed on at least 38 wells, adding more than a billion gallons to the amount of water businesses were allowed to extract monthly.\n",
      "The wells had potential to lower water levels in Pleasant Lake, Round Lake, Lake Emily\n",

      "A second federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending protections for Dreamers — undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. The ruling requires the Department of Homeland Security to continue accepting renewal applications for Dreamers protected by the Obama-era Deferred Action for Child Arrivals (DACA) program, which President Donald Trump moved to end last year.\n",
      "Tuesday's ruling from New York district court judge Nicholas Garaufis follows a similar preliminary injunction issued last month by California judge William Alsup. As Mother Jones has written, the Trump administration has taken the rare step of appealing Alsup's decision straight to the Supreme Court. But it has not sought not to immediately stop, or \"stay, \" the injunction. As a result, DACA renewals are likely to remain open for months, and possibly through the November midterm elections.\n",
      "Both district court rulings require DHS to accept applications from DACA recipients whose protections are expiring, as well as those whose two-year work permits have already expired. They do not require DHS to accept applications from people who have never been protected by DACA.\n",
      "Garaufis did not dispute that the Trump administration has the authority to end DACA. Instead, his decision holds that the administration likely violated a federal statute known as the Administrative Procedure Act by winding down DACA in an \"arbitrary and capricious\" manner. He concluded that a temporary injunction is necessary because ending DACA would likely cause \"irreparable harm\" to DACA recipients:\n",
      "If the decision is allowed to go into effect prior to a full adjudication on the merits, there is no way the court can \"unscramble the egg\" and undo the damage caused by what, on the record before it, appears to have been a patently arbitrary and capricious decision.\n",

      "A 1-year moratorium of the ACA's tax on health insurers\n",
      "Be smart: Conservatives don't love this bill because it doesn't include as much defense spending as they wanted; Democrats largely don't like it because it would only last a month and doesn't include an immigration deal.\n",
      "If this agreement can pass, health care seems like the key to passing it — CHIP to peel off just enough Democrats, especially in the Senate; and delays in ACA taxes to help keep just enough conservatives from jumping ship.\n",
      "Countdown: We're headed for a government shutdown on Friday if Congress can't figure this out. Federal CHIP funding expired at the end of September.\n",
      "Meanwhile, health insurers aren't thrilled about the fact that the bill would freeze their ACA tax for 2019, but not 2018. Lawmakers are apparently concerned that it's too late for consumers to see any benefit from keeping the tax on ice this year.\n",

      "The White House released a tax and spending plan Monday that would not eliminate the federal budget deficit after 10 years, its first public acknowledgment that large spending increases and the $1.5 trillion tax cut are putting severe pressure on the government's debt.\n",
      "The proposal, titled \"Efficient, Effective, Accountable: An American Budget, \" sets forth President Trump's priorities as Congress prepares to consider spending bills for the next fiscal year.\n",
      "The plan would continue to markedly increase military spending and set aside money for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. It seeks to authorize $4.4 trillion in spending for 2019, up 10 percent from the amount of money the government spent in 2017.\n",
      "The plan also calls for major cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and other social programs — reductions that conservatives have long sought.\n",
      "But even with these reductions, which add up to more than $3 trillion in cuts over 10 years, the proposal would not bring the budget into balance because of the lost tax revenue and higher spending on other programs.\n",
      "The White House projects a large gap between government spending and tax revenue over the next decade, adding at least $7 trillion to the debt over that time. In 2019 and 2020 alone, the government would add a combined $2 trillion in debt under Trump's plan.\n",

      "When we talk about the insider, who are we talking about? It's the comfortable politician only looking out for his own interest. It is the lobbyist who knows how to put that perfect loophole in every single bill to get richer and richer and richer at your expense.\n",

      "Fact: This claim is misleading. Large, self-insured companies, such as Nike and Intel, are indeed exempt from new health care insurance taxes underlying Measure 101. But that's not because slick lobbyists bought off Oregon lawmakers. It's because of federal law. \"Because self-insured plans are not purchased from an insurance carrier licensed by the state, they are exempt from state requirements and subject only to federal regulation, \" explains a brief from the National Council of State Legislatures.

      "Fact: Again, that's misleading. Over the past year, the total number of Oregon Medicaid patients did decline by about 38,000, to 1,050,000. But the state budget is based on a patient forecast, and that forecast predicted a modest decline. In fact, the Medicaid caseload actually exceeded projections by about an average of 20,000 patients per month for the past year, according to Oregon Health Authority figures. If the trend continues, we may need slightly more money than lawmakers projected.\n",

      "You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen. But do you recall Saint Nicholas of Myra, the man behind Santa Claus? The jolly old elf of Christmastime lore is an embellishment on the historical persona of a Christian pastor from the 4th century. People adapted his legacy to suit their cultural needs, altering his attributes as they went along. As a result, the man behind the holiday fable is shrouded in myths and misconceptions. Here are five.\n",
      "Saint Nicholas was a white European.\n",
      "In the vast majority of depictions, Santa Claus, Saint Nicholas and Father Christmas are portrayed as white-skinned Europeans with rosy cheeks and white beards. Former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly could have pointed to innumerable examples from film, art, toys and advertisements when, in a 2013 broadcast, she asserted that \"Santa just is white .\"\n",
      "But Nicholas had a Mediterranean complexion and spoke Greek. He was born sometime after 260 in Patara, a port town on the coast of modern-day Turkey. The region had been colonized by the Greeks centuries earlier. The racial category of \"white\" wasn't one the ancient world was acquainted with, and it would not have occurred to anyone at the time to describe themselves in that way.\n",

      "From 1931 to 1964, artist Haddon Sundblom painted enchantingly warm scenes of Santa's home and hearth for the Coca-Cola Company . Norman Rockwell depicted Santa for the Saturday Evening Post looking cheerful and glad. And before that, Thomas Nast drew Santa for Harper's Weekly with his traditional red coat, white beard, round belly and pipe. Nast can be credited with working out the major aspects of Santa's look in his fanciful and imaginative drawings, which date to the second half of the 19th\n"

      "SUNDAY READS: Vaughan captain Len Ridding retires after three decades fighting fires\n",
      "by Simone Joseph\n",
      "On Feb. 26, 2001, acting captain Len Ridding woke up having no idea he would experience one of the most memorable moments of his career that day.\n",
      "His team — Vaughan's fire and rescue service C — was called to a fire at a 14,000 square-foot house in the Weston and Teston Roads area.\n",
      "Water tankers from Richmond Hill Fire, King City and Nobleton were called in.\n",
      "Ridding was outside of the house at 9 p.m. when a mayday call came over the radio.\n",
      "Before fighting fires, Ridding was surrounded by water — first as a teenaged lifeguard in Toronto and later as a search and rescue scuba diver for Toronto Harbour Police. Ridding and his colleagues were expected to become police officers when the harbour police joined forces with the Metropolitan Toronto Police in the 1980s. At the time, Ridding doubted this career was right for him.\n",
      "Ridding was a swimmer on Canada's national swim team. One of his coaches was Bob Dyak, a North York firefighter who urged him to switch over to firefighting. Ridding applied to fire departments across the GTA and was accepted into North York, Scarborough and Vaughan. Dyak encouraged him to accept the Vaughan offer since this was a smaller department where he could rapidly advance.\n",
      "Ridding had already come into contact with fires and firefighters while submerged in the world of search and rescue. He remembers a fire at Olympic Island (one of the Toronto Islands) when somewhere between 60 and 80 boats caught fire. Toronto fire didn't have enough equipment and the marine unit had a fire pump so Ridding gave this pump to a Toronto firefighter. Ridding was about 19. He remembers sitting on the sidelines, watching as the important work was being done.\n",
      "\"These guys were doing exciting work. I wanted to be them ... I thought that's a cool job — fighting fire on Olympic Island.\"\n",

      "We have word about what's going into the space that , for 30 years, held the storied Ritz Grill. The replacement restaurant is called Colorado Craft , it's set to open on Monday, Jan. 22, and it's run by known figures in the Springs dining scene.Chef/c😲wner Mario Vasquez has been in kitchens for around 10 years, including a stint at the five-star, five-diamond resort Montage Laguna Beach. Since moving to Colorado two years ago, he's worked at TILL Kitchen and Garden of the Gods Market and Cafe, both owned by Altitude Hospitality Group. It's at the latter where he met Craft general manager/c😲wner Bryan Bradigan, formerly of Cowboy Star. Vasquez says he'd wanted to start his own business for some time but lacked the financial and front-of-house experience necessary; in Bradigan, he found a complementary skill set. And in c😲wner Dave Lux, who also c😲wns the building with Concept Restaurants partner Luke Travins, they found the right patron.\"[Bradigan and I] ended up sitting down every Monday together and going over this plan of what we wanted to do, what that was going to look like, \" says Vasquez. What it looks like, at least at the restaurant's outset, is hip but approachable recipes using Colorado-sourced ingredients. Vasquez plans to change it up four times a year.\"We're going to make a green chili chicken wing that's kind of Asian-influenced, \" he says. They'll be using green chilies to make a sweet chili sauce akin to ubiquitous Mae Ploy. He also teases beer fries tossed in a beer salt made with Red Leg Brewing Company's Blue Nose Brown, which also appears in an accompanying mustard-mayonnaise sauce. There's also a poutine made from chunks of russet potato with bacon, mushroom gravy and Wisconsin cheese curds. At a media preview dinner, we also sampled a house salad made from greens grown in Larkspur, a baby beet salad with farro, a burrata served with garlic confit and bacon, and a crisp Nashville hot chicken sandwich. Vasquez will also deploy a recipe for green\n",

      "Time is running out yet again for Congress to agree on a long-term solution for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), a bipartisan measure that insures close to 9 million children and pregnant women across the US.\n",
      "CHIP expired September 30, threatening coverage for millions of recipients who would likely otherwise be uninsured. While the 20-year-old program enjoys wide support from Republicans and Democrats, they have been unable to compromise on an extension over a funding dispute.\n",

      "\"Mr. Weyeneth has decided to depart ... at the end of the month, \" the White House said in a statement obtained by the Post. He had previously been reassigned to \"administrative work\" after questions arose about his background.\n",
      "Weyeneth, a 24-year-old former Trump campaign worker, was appointed last year to be the deputy chief of staff at the Office of National Drug Control Policy, or ONDCP, the agency tasked with coordinating federal drug-control efforts. However, as the Post originally reported, Weyeneth had nearly no previous experience after he graduated college in May 2016, aside from working for Donald Trump's presidential campaign and transition.\n",
      "Questions quickly arose about his qualifications after multiple discrepancies popped up on several of his resumes and reports surfaced that another job he held at a New York law firm in 2015 ended after Weyeneth failed to show up for work.\n",
      "He appeared to rise quickly at the ONDCP due to a high level of staff turnover and numerous vacancies at the agency. During the recent government shutdown, the Post noted, Weyeneth was one of three employees at the agency that continued to work after he was listed as essential.\n",
      "News of his departure comes just a week after 10 Democratic senators expressed their displeasure with Weyeneth's appointment. In a letter sent to the White House, the group accused Trump of failing to fill key roles at the ONDCP and the Drug Enforcement Agency and falling behind on promises to tackle the opioid epidemic.\n",

      "A second federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending protections for Dreamers — undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. The ruling requires the Department of Homeland Security to continue accepting renewal applications for Dreamers protected by the Obama-era Deferred Action for Child Arrivals (DACA) program, which President Donald Trump moved to end last year.\n",
      "Tuesday's ruling from New York district court judge Nicholas Garaufis follows a similar preliminary injunction issued last month by California judge William Alsup. As Mother Jones has written, the Trump administration has taken the rare step of appealing Alsup's decision straight to the Supreme Court. But it has not sought not to immediately stop, or \"stay, \" the injunction. As a result, DACA renewals are likely to remain open for months, and possibly through the November midterm elections.\n",
      "Both district court rulings require DHS to accept applications from DACA recipients whose protections are expiring, as well as those whose two-year work permits have already expired. They do not require DHS to accept applications from people who have never been protected by DACA.\n",
      "Garaufis did not dispute that the Trump administration has the authority to end DACA. Instead, his decision holds that the administration likely violated a federal statute known as the Administrative Procedure Act by winding down DACA in an \"arbitrary and capricious\" manner. He concluded that a temporary injunction is necessary because ending DACA would likely cause \"irreparable harm\" to DACA recipients:\n",
      "If the decision is allowed to go into effect prior to a full adjudication on the merits, there is no way the court can \"unscramble the egg\" and undo the damage caused by what, on the record before it, appears to have been a patently arbitrary and capricious decision.\n",

      "WASHINGTON — President Trump's first State of the Union Address did little to change the hearts and minds of a group of swing voters who liked his call for more vocational education and paid family leave but rated the speech overall as not terribly convincing.\n",
      "\"He looked presidential, he said all the right things, but let's see what he implements, \" said Lauren Price, a retired government worker who watched the speech Tuesday night with other voters as part of a focus group organized by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington-based think tank.\n",
      "Matthew Mielke, a business contractor from Washington, D.C., said Trump spoke well, was on message and looked presidential.\n",
      "\"But we always grade him on a weird curve, \" Mielke said. \"If he's not foaming at the mouth and screaming, we say he did a good job.\"\n",
      "Overall, the dozen voters in the group rated the speech \"on the plus side of mediocre, \" said Rich Thau, president of Engagious, the message testing firm that organized the group on behalf of the policy center.\n",
      "When asked if Trump said anything during the address that would have changed the way they voted in the 2016 presidential election, all 12 voters said no.\n",
      "\"There was not a single Trump voter who after watching that speech abandoned him and went for Hillary (Clinton), \" Thau said. \"And there were no Hillary voters who said I should have abandoned her and gone to him.\"\n",
      "The group also found Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III, who gave the Democratic response, equally unconvincing. Some described him as a fresh face but said they don't know what he stands for.\n",

There was one unequivocal success: A president who, over the course of his first 12 months in that office, has often seemed unmoored or uncontrolled on Tuesday night offered a composed, deliberate vision of what his presidency could be.\n",

      "ABC says it's 98 percent sold out of commercial time in its Oscars telecast — \"way ahead\" of where it was at the equivalent time last year, says Rita Ferro, president of sales at Disney-ABC TV Group.\n",
      "The network said in 2017 that it had sold out of commercial time for the broadcast on Feb. 18, eight days before the show aired on Feb. 26. This year the Oscars will air on March 4 to steer clear of this month's Winter Olympics.\n",
      "Ferro says she wants to elevate Oscars advertising in the eyes of marketers and consumers to make it something more like the Super Bowl, where viewers pay close attention to elaborate new commercials. But the Super Bowl remains a far bigger event, averaging 103.4 million viewers on traditional TV last Sunday. The 2017 Oscars averaged just under 33 million viewers. Nearly all of the ads airing during the Super Bowl were made specifically for the game, so the Oscars still has a ways to go to compete.\n",
      "All the same, Ferro says 10 sponsors will have custom content in this year's Oscar's telecast, up from five last year, with nearly a month still to go.\n",
      "Buyers represent categories including automotive, retail and beverages, says Ferro, adding that there was especially strong demand from technology and marketers in the \"internet of things\" category.\n",
      "But the real takeaway, she says, is a focus on creative that promotes female empowerment, as marketers choose not go quietly into Hollywood's big night following numerous allegations of sexual harassment and worse against prominent celebrities and entertainment titans.\n",
      "Female-focused ads would be in stark contrast with Super Bowl LII spots, which remained male-dominated again this year. In fact, Ferro says some advertisers specifically bought the Oscars, which airs just four days before International Woman's Day, to celebrate women.\n",

      "ON THE MORNING AFTER HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WOMEN (and many men) marched across cities large and small, the five major Sunday talk shows booked interviews with more than a dozen lawmakers and government officials: all were men .\n",
      "— Clearly, the government shutdown is a big news story and key figures like White House budget director Mick Mulvaney and Democratic Senator Dick Durbin were in demand for interviews. (It should be noted Rep. Nanette Diaz Barragan did participate in a CNN panel on the shutdown). But it was striking that a large-scale mobilization on the one-year anniversary of President Donald Trump's inauguration was barely mentioned on the five shows, according to a Media Matters tally. The march was covered on cable news over the weekend, at times sharing the screen with the debate in Washington over the shutdown — and who should shoulder the blame.\n",
      "Story Continued Below\n",
      "— Typically, the party in power takes the most heat. And for the first time in modern history, a single party, the Republicans, control the White House, Senate, and House during a shutdown. But as my colleague Jason Schwartz wrote , there wasn't a clear-cut narrative in the news media on Saturday, with each side trying to influence coverage and seizing on reports buttressing their view. House Republicans reportedly touted New York Times and Associated Press headlines faulting the Democrats.\n",
      "— Trump once indicated the buck stops with the president when there's a government shutdown and his 2013 comments on Fox News blaming then-President Obama surfaced again. While critics saw hypocrisy, the president presumably saw something else. The New York Times reported that Trump spent most of Saturday \"watching old TV clips of him berating President Barack Obama for a lack of leadership during the 2013 government shutdown...seeming content to sit back and watch the show.\"\n",

      "The Killers may have headlined a few Lollapaloozas, but their show at United Center on Tuesday marked new territory. Charismatic singer Brandon Flowers told the packed house that dreams come true, even though genetics prevented his supposed childhood hopes of how he imagined he'd perform at the venue one day: playing for the Chicago Bulls. \"If this is the alternative, \" he said. \"I'll take it.\"\n",
      "Having composed stadium-sized, shout-along anthems that include several hits since the band released its 2004 \"Hot Fuss\" debut album, the Killers' UC appearance seemed more a foregone conclusion than Flowers let on. Coupled with their homegrown, Las Vegas-styled showmanship, they delivered an arena-worthy performance with sparkly, neon-lit, confetti-punctuated production to match.\n",
      "Touring behind its fifth album and first in five years, \"Wonderful Wonderful, \" the Killers have continued to hone their amalgam of dance and rock flavorings. And while their commitment to being noncommittal genre-wise hasn't always jelled on record, Flowers and company's penchant for rhythm-driven song structures and dramatic wordplay felt tailor-made for a live setting.\n",
      "That's also a testament to Flowers, who is one of the most compelling contemporary frontmen around. Every song was sung with bravado. He could turn a nonsensical line into an epic mantra (the buoyant, fan-chanted \"I got soul, but I'm not a soldier\" from \"All These Things That I've Done\"), the cryptic came off earnest and sincere (\"Are we human or are we dancer?\" he asked on the grooving \"Human\") and the youthful boasts in the tongue-in-cheek, disco-tipped \"The Man\" were just plain fun. His swaggering onstage presence, which included Elvis Presley-inspired moves, enhanced his allure.\n",

      "But last month's weather-induced boost in power consumption probably won't last.\n",
      "TVA's total power load last year was down by more than 10 percent from a decade ago and the federal utility projects demand for electricity will be essentially flat or down even more over the next decade. TVA, which long banked on annual electricity growth of as much as 7 percent, now predicts power demand in 2027 will be nearly 13 percent below the peak level reached 20 years earlier in 2007.\n",
      "More energy efficient appliances, machines and heat pumps are reducing the demand for more electricity even as cheaper natural gas and self-generated sources of power from solar panels, wind mills and geothermal systems are capable of generating more power for customers in the Tennessee Valley from sources other than TVA.\n",
      "The Tennessee Valley Authority, which helped electrify an impoverished Appalachian region during the Great Depression to help spur much of the region's growth over the past century, heats a bigger share of homes with electricity than in other parts of America and is being hit harder than many utilities by the drop in power demand. But TVA is certainly not alone in the impact of America's power shift.\n",
      "\"Every utility in America right now is trying to figure out how to handle the impacts of energy efficiency standards and the move to much more energy efficient lighting and heating, \" said Doug Peters, president of the Tennessee Valley Public Power Association, which represents the 154 municipalities and power cooperatives that buy and distribute TVA's power across its seven-state region. \"When you are in a period of declining demand and energy efficiency and consumer-owned generation is putting more pressure on revenue recovery, it's a real challenge.\"\n",

      "The US Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear two racial gerrymandering cases out of Texas after a federal district court found the state's political maps intentionally discriminate against minority voters. This is the third major redistricting case the court will hear this term that has the power to shape political maps across the country.\n",
      "This summer, a three-judge panel in San Antonio found that Texas Republicans intentionally weakened the voting power of African American and Latino voters when it drew multiple state House and congressional districts. This was the ninth racial discrimination in voting case the state has lost since 2011, which includes a long legal battle over its stringent voter ID requirement. Now, the Supreme Court will determine whether Texas' maps can stand.\n",
      "The Supreme Court's decision to take the case is not surprising. The court's conservative majority signaled sympathy with Texas Republicans in September when the five conservatives, including Justice Anthony Kennedy, blocked the lower court's order to redraw Texas' maps until the high court could rule on the case. The four liberal justices dissented from the order. This means Democrats and voting rights advocates will face an uphill battle when the court hears this case.\n",

      "After Texas created new maps in 2011, a federal district court in Texas this year found that certain districts in those maps — as well as slightly altered maps adopted in 2013 — were drawn in a way that discriminated against Hispanic and African American voters. The court also found that the Republican-controlled legislature intentionally discriminated in creating those districts.

I read it this morning, and I tweeted it. It's fantastic. But there's absolutely an assault on our institutions and on our core values as a country.

      "Jordan High School freshman Taylor Tilby said she never really felt left out or different around her teammates. \"They have included me a lot and made me feel so loved, \" Tilby said. \"They'll always be there for me.\" Tilby has thrombocytopenia-absent radius (TAR) syndrome and uses a prosthetic leg, but she doesn't let that stop her from pursuing her love of dance. \"I think that everyone sees Taylor as an inspiration, \" assistant coach Stephanie Darrow said. \"Like (Tilby) said, our team has never seen her disability. Taylor earned that spot on the floor just as everybody else does.\" Pictured above: Tilby, right, warms up with other Jordan Charlonians before the drill team takes the floor during the state semifinals at Utah Valley University in Orem on Thursday, Feb. 1, 2018.\n",

      "\"I was scared because the team kind of scared me, \" she said. \"I don't like to compare myself to others, to what they can do. I was nervous because I didn't know what the other girls would think of me being on the team.\"\n",

      "\"With a handful of follows and some likes on Twitter, my fate has been sealed in your minds. To write an edgy story, to create sensationalist coverage, there are few lengths you wouldn't go to mark me as the man you desperately want me to be.\n",
      "\"You would rather perpetuate propaganda machines instead of researching information from a host of angles and perspectives while being willing to learn, change and grow. You dehumanize with pen and paper and turn neighbor against neighbor. In so doing, you may actually find you're hastening the hell you wish to avoid, the hell we all wish to avoid.\n",

      "After the repatriation tax payment, the company will have $207 billion left over from the move it can use for investments, acquisitions, stock buybacks or larger dividends. Apple said it plans more than $30 billion in capital expenditures in the U.S. during the next five years.\n",
      "Apple had $252.3 billion in overseas cash as of the end of September quarter, according to SEC filings, so that means the company is paying tax on nearly all of that foreign cash.\n",

This nationally recognized skill credential measures an individual's skill level in applied math, workplace documents and graphic literacy - skills required for 77 percent of jobs based on the ACT JobPro database.\n",
      "\"The ACT certification is a portable, evidence-based credential that certifies the essential skills for workplace success, \" said Toni Overholser , director of workforce and business solutions for Clark State. \"Employers look for it from job candidates, whether they come directly from high school or through postsecondary paths, because it is a valid predictor of job performance.\"\n",

      "Amy Donahoe , director of workforce development with the Greater Springfield Chamber of Commerce, said the designation of a WRC will benefit Clark County in several areas. \"Job seekers will be able to show employers their potential for upward mobility during interviews, \" she said. \"Employers will be able to look at the test scores and see the cognitive ability of the individual, hence having the ability to match the individual with the 'right fit' in the organization.

      "A federal court ruled that a California high school can't force its football players to stand for the national anthem, the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday.\n",
      "The court ruling bars the San Pasqual Valley Unified School District from setting rules that prohibit \"kneeling, sitting or similar forms of political protest\" at sports events and require students and coaches to \"stand and remove hats/helmets... during the playing or singing of the National Anthem, \" according to a December 21 ruling by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California.\n",
      "The school district set its rules after a Native American high school football player — identified as V.A. in court documents — took a knee during the national anthem ahead of a game between rival teams from California and Arizona. V.A. was protesting racial injustice in the United States in the same way NFL players kneel before national anthems to protest police brutality and racism.\n",
      "V.A.'s action sparked students at the rival Mayer High School in Spring Valley, Arizona to shout racial slurs. They also threatened to force him to stand. One San Pasqual Valley cheerleader was soaked by a water bottle. Mayer High School is majority white; San Pasqual Valley is majority Native American and Latinx. In response, San Pasqual Valley school superintendent Rauna Fox passed a rule prohibiting protests. She also required students and coaches to remove their hats and helmets and stand for the national anthem.\n",
      "The federal court's temporary injunction — which allows students to resume protests — states that the school violated V.A.'s First Amendment right to political expression. It also said that schools can curb these expressions when they threaten to disrupt the educational mission. The court agreed with the claims of V.A.'s lawsuit that \"public school students have constitutional rights to freedom of speech and expression that they do not shed at the schoolhouse gate, on the playing field, or on the basketball court.\"\n",

      "Jarchow tweeted his concession to Schachtner late Tuesday evening, with returns nearly complete across five northwestern Wisconsin counties and Schachtner leading by more than 1,600 votes. Schachtner, the St. Croix County medical examiner and a Somerset school board member, had entered the race in northwestern Wisconsin's traditionally conservative 10th Senate District as the clear underdog.\n",
      "The district has trended red for years. Republican Sheila Harsdorf held the Senate seat for 16 years before she resigned in November to become Gov. Scott Walker's agriculture secretary. Every county in the district voted for Trump in 2016. Jarchow is in the middle of his third term representing the area in the Assembly and had built a formidable base.\n",
      "But Democrats banked that anti-Trump backlash could even the playing field. Republicans sensed it, too. Conservative groups Americans for Prosperity and the Republican State Leadership Committee both ran ads supporting Jarchow and Republican state Sen. Leah Vukmir, who is running for U.S. Senate, traveled to the district to campaign for him.\n",
      "It wasn't enough, even in a district that Barack Obama lost by 6 points in 2012 and Hillary Clinton lost by 17 to Trump.\n",
      "Schachtner said her win sends a message that voters are tired of negative politics.\n",
      "\"People sent a message tonight we don't want to be negative any more, \" she said. \"Change it up. I ran a positive campaign. ... My message has always been be kind, be considerate and we need to help people when they're down.\"\n",

      "The wonders of technology are rapidly changing things. It is a \"snow day\" in much of North Georgia, but my kids went to bed knowing they have a Digital Learning Day. In other words, they still have school. Snow days cause me to reminisce to when I was a kid in Georgia, and we looked forward to the rare day of playtime in the snow. As I stare out of my home office window, the scientist in me is reminded of some interesting things that seems to happen when snow is on the ground. You may have noticed them too so I am using my \"snow day\" to explain the science behind them.\n",
      "The first interesting observation takes me back to an old song by the rock group Styx called \"Snow Blind.\" While I cannot be certain that they were talking about actual snow, the concept of snowblind is real. When there is fresh snow on the ground and a bright, sunny sky, it can be very bright and blinding. This happens because of the high albedo of snow. Ok, what is that? The term \"albedo\" represents how well a surface reflects solar energy although it's typically most relevant to the visible part of sun's energy. Albedo values typically range from 0 (perfect absorber) to 1 (reflects 100% of the energy). Darker surfaces tend to have a lower albedo than lighter surfaces. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) website explains,\n",
      "typical ocean albedo is approximately 0.06, while bare sea ice varies from approximately 0.5 to 0.7. This means that the ocean reflects only 6 percent of the incoming solar radiation and absorbs the rest, while sea ice reflects 50 to 70 percent of the incoming energy. The sea ice absorbs less solar energy and keeps the surface cooler. Snow has an even higher albedo than sea ice, and so thick sea ice covered with snow reflects as much as 90 percent of the incoming solar radiation.\n",
      "As snow cover ages, melts or becomes dirty, its albedo decreases.\n",

      "Senators blasted Uber over their handling of a 2016 data breach and how it might affect a cybersecurity incentive program used to hide the breach from the public at a Senate Commerce Subcommittee hearing Tuesday.\n",
      "Why it matters: The breach affected 57 million users worldwide, including 25 million in the United States. Uber opted not to notify the consumers whose data was stolen, instead paying the hackers to delete the data which was potentially in violation of many state breach notification laws. The fact that it took years to notify the public \"raises red flags in this committee, \" said Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data Security Chair Jerry Moran (R-KS).\n",

      "Why the coverup might harm other security programs: Uber paid the hacker to delete the files using money from a bug bounty program, which incentivizes good guy hackers to alert companies of security flaws that companies can then fix independently.\n",
      "Katie Moussouris, the chief executive of Luta Security and an internationally recognized bug bounty guru, told the subcommittee that paying a hacker who maliciously stole records using bug bounty funds \"muddied\" the difference between a beneficial program and extortion.\n",

      "JEFFERSON CITY • Measures that would keep complaints against large employers private have gained favor in the House and Senate, but the state's top law enforcement officer has signaled his discontent, at least in certain cases.\n",
      "Legislation that's progressed in the House and Senate would give arbitrators the authority to decide whether an arbitration agreement between an employer and an employee is enforceable. Studies have shown that employers win more often than employees during arbitration , which is a private system of justice with no appeal process.\n",
      "But Josh Hawley, Missouri's attorney general and a Republican, along with every other state's attorney general, signed a letter this week asking Congress to outlaw arbitration in the case of sexual harassment.\n",
      "\"We, as a nation, must do better to protect victims of sexual harassment, and part of this is allowing them access to the judicial system in lieu of forced arbitration, \" Hawley said in a statement.\n",
      "During debate on the proposed legislation, which is pending before the House and Senate, bill sponsors denied allegations that arbitration agreements protect sexual harassers.\n",
      "Rep. Gina Mitten, D-Richmond Heights, said during a committee hearing that the proposal would silence those who have been sexually harassed — an egregious development, she said, during the \"me too\" movement .\n",
      "\"This is not a partisan issue, \" she said. \"Gretchen Carlson, whom I think we can pretty well agree is not my liberal best friend, has said, 'Arbitration agreements are a sexual harasser's dream.'\"\n",

      "View Images A blue marlin swims in the Sea of Cortez off Baja California. Marlin are among the fish that are crowding toward the surface in some parts of the ocean as they flee low-oxygen zones in the deep.\n",
      "One day more than a decade ago, Eric Prince was studying the tracks of tagged fish when he noticed something odd. Blue marlin off the southeastern United States would dive a half-mile deep chasing prey. The same species off Costa Rica and Guatemala stayed near the surface, rarely dropping more than a few hundred feet.\n",
      "Prince, a billfish expert who has since retired from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, was stumped. Head studied blue marlin off the Ivory Coast and Ghana, Jamaica and Brazil, and head never seen anything like it. Why wouldn't these expert divers dive?\n",
      "The billfish, it turns out, were trying to avoid suffocation. The marlin near Guatemala and Costa Rica wouldn't plunge into the murky depths because they were avoiding a deep, gigantic and expanding swath of water that contained too little oxygen. The discovery was among the first examples of the many ways sea life is already shifting in response to a new reality that hasn't gotten much attention: Marine waters, even far out in the high seas, are losing oxygen thanks to climate change, upending where and how sea creatures live.\n",
      "\"This is a global problem, and global warming is making it worse, \" says Denise Breitburg, senior scientist at the Smithsonian Research Center. \"It requires global solutions, \" she says.\n",
      "Breitburg is the lead author of a new study published today in Science that examined all the major research on ocean oxygen loss. The authors conclude that itas emptying vast regions of the ocean, changing what and where creatures live and eat, threatening to shrink fish populations and individual fish, and making overfishing more likely. Like warming seas and ocean acidification, oxygen loss is one of the most important byproducts of climate change, but one that few pe\n",

      "Despite their name, ice giants are actually hot as heck. Sure, temperatures in the upper atmosphere hover hundreds of degrees Fahrenheit below zero, thanks to the planets' distance from the sun. But as you approach the core, the immense pressure crushing the interior heats things up thousands of degrees. These balmy temps and crushing pressures could theoretically prime hydrogen and carbon to form diamond rain some 5,000 miles below the outer surface of the atmosphere.\n",
      "\"Previously, researchers could only assume that the diamonds had formed, \" Dominik Kraus, scientist at Helmholtz Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf and lead author of a study on the results, said in a statement . \"When I saw the results of this latest experiment, it was one of the best moments of my scientific career.\"\n",
      "When subjected to the pressures (and temperatures) of life on other planets, even familiar substances can get pretty alien. Case in point: the diamond rains of the ice giants. Scientists have long thought that massive planets like Neptune and Uranus — which contain relatively tiny rocky cores covered with a mantle of slurried water, ammonia, and methane ices and surrounded by a thick atmosphere — are subject to rain made of literal diamonds. Now researchers have synthesized the process in a lab, showing how such conditions might occur.\n",
      "To replicate the process, scientists had to make some (very) hot and (very) heavy conditions. They used an intense laser to send a pair of overlapping shockwaves through polystryene — a plastic, made from hydrogen and carbon, that can simulate the behavior of methane compounds. The shockwaves created a brief moment of pressure and heat comparable to everyday life in an ice giant's interior.\n",
      "\"The experimental time is very short, \" Kraus told The Guardian. \"That we saw this very clear signature of diamonds was actually very, very surprising.\"\n"

      "In an effort to combat the problem of opioid addiction and overdoses, Assemblyman Freddie Rodriguez, D-Pomona, has introduced legislation to restrict the ability of doctors to prescribe opioids for more than 3 days at a time. Under the proposal, patients could refill their prescriptions at a pharmacy up to three times, but on the fourth refill, the doctor would have to explain why additional medication is needed.\n",
      "It's one of those proposals that superficially sounds like it could really help. If one believes that opioids are highly addictive and that more opioids being prescribed means more people will become addicted and that many will end up dying, then it makes sense that cutting down on opioid prescriptions could save lives.\n",
      "As appealing as that line of thinking seems, a look at the relationship between opioid prescriptions and overdose deaths reveals that government efforts to cut the supply of opioids is itself a major driver of the opioid overdose problem in the first place, not a solution.\n",
      "It's a simple, and tragic, example of the unintended consequences of well-intentioned but shortsighted policy making.\n",
      "While nationwide opioid prescriptions declined 18 percent between 2010 and 2015, the rate of overdoses sharply increased from 12.3 per 100,000 population in 2010 to 16.3 in 2015.\n",
      "The decrease in prescriptions was driven by efforts of the Obama administration, the Office of National Drug Control, the Drug Enforcement Administration and several state governments to reduce opioid misuse and perceived over-prescribing through greater enforcement, stricter rules and prosecutions of doctors and pharmacists, according to the Drug Policy Alliance.\n",
      "Rather than saving lives, many who were using prescription opioids turned to to drugs like heroin, which, because of its illegality, is often highly variable in purity and which is often cut with other, more pot\n",

      "A few hours after lowering the submersible even more, to t0 8,178 meters, or 26,830 feet, the team filmed a lonely snailfish that came to poke around the remains of the mackerel.\n",

      "Republicans, Democrats and a coalition of redistricting-reform advocates reached a deal to put a proposal on the May ballot aimed at curtailing partisan gerrymandering of Ohio's congressional map.\n",
      "After weekend negotiations that capped off about two weeks of heavy talks, the Senate on Monday night voted 31-0 for the compromise plan. The House is likely to approve it Tuesday, one day ahead of the Feb. 7 deadline to qualify the issue for the May statewide ballot.\n",
      "The current redistricting process requires no minority-party support and has almost no rules, other than requirements regarding district population and prohibiting conflict with the federal Voting Rights Act. The new proposal would initially require 50 percent of the minority party in each chamber to approve a map for 10 years. It also would limit how often counties can be split into multiple congressional seats, and it would require public hearings and the ability for the public to submit maps.\n",
      "Under that plan, 65 counties cannot be divided, 18 can be divided once and five can be divided twice into three congressional districts. Currently, many counties are split, while Cuyahoga and Summit counties in Democrat-rich northeast Ohio are split into four districts as Republicans sliced them up for partisan advantage.\n",

      "Last year, Trump had reluctantly signed the bill creating new sanctions on Russia for the country's interference in the 2016 presidential election. Reports from the intelligence community found that Russia purposely meddled in the election in the hope of helping Trump get elected, and a salacious dossier compiled by a former British spy claimed that Trump's campaign actively colluded with Russia.\n",

      "The governors of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, California, Oregon and Washington have all opposed offshore drilling plans. Virginia's governor-elect, Ralph S. Northam, a Democrat, said in a statement Thursday that expanding drilling would jeopardize his state's tourism and fishing industries, as well as military installations. Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, also a Democrat, called drilling a \"critical threat\" to his state's economy.\n",

      "The Obama administration blocked drilling on about 94 percent of the outer continental shelf, the submerged offshore area between state coastal waters and the deep ocean. Mr. Zinke charged that those restrictions had cost the United States billions of dollars in lost revenue and said the new proposal would make about 90 percent of those waters available for leasing.\n",

      "The work is being partially funded through the new Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation account, which was established with the adoption of Senate Bill 1 — the gas tax — into law April 2017.\n",
      "Public Works Director John Gay told the Board the additional funds are \"extremely important\" to enable them to get started on these improvement projects and alluded to an increase of projects that will go out for bid between the spring and the summer.\n",
      "\"As we move through this year, you're going to see more projects coming before you for SB 1, \" Gay said.\n",
      "The project consists of road improvements across a one mile stretch of Dogwood Road which extends from Villa Road in the south up to nearly Aten Road, in the north. The estimate for the completion of the project exceeds $1.8 million.\n",
      "Gay noted that in a recent discussion with the California State Association of Counties, he was told the county is projected to receive up to $17 million, almost three times as much funding as the department had for 2017.\n",
      "\"(This) increase represents a huge impact on our department. It really moves the needle in improving our road infrastructure and bridge network, \" he said.\n",
      "The Board approved the request for bids with a 4-0 vote.\n",
      "The Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017 is expected to generate $5.4 billion per year and more than $50 billion in the next 10 years to address the backlog of unfunded transportation projects, estimated to be at about $130 billion.\n",
      "The money will be collected by a 12 cent per gallon increase in the gas tax, a 20 cent increase to the diesel excise tax, a 5 percent increase to the diesel sales excise tax, an annual $100 fee for electric vehicles, a new annual vehicle fee ranging from $25 to $175, depending on the value of the vehicle and gene\n",

      "Overall losses, including uninsured damage, came to $330 billion, according to the reinsurer , Munich Re of Germany. That tally was second only to 2011, when an earthquake and tsunami in Japan contributed to losses of $354 billion at today's dollars.\n",

      "In an effort to combat the problem of opioid addiction and overdoses, Assemblyman Freddie Rodriguez, D-Pomona, has introduced legislation to restrict the ability of doctors to prescribe opioids for more than 3 days at a time. Under the proposal, patients could refill their prescriptions at a pharmacy up to three times, but on the fourth refill, the doctor would have to explain why additional medication is needed.\n",
      "It's one of those proposals that superficially sounds like it could really help. If one believes that opioids are highly addictive and that more opioids being prescribed means more people will become addicted and that many will end up dying, then it makes sense that cutting down on opioid prescriptions could save lives.\n",
      "As appealing as that line of thinking seems, a look at the relationship between opioid prescriptions and overdose deaths reveals that government efforts to cut the supply of opioids is itself a major driver of the opioid overdose problem in the first place, not a solution.\n",
      "It's a simple, and tragic, example of the unintended consequences of well-intentioned but shortsighted policy making.\n",
      "While nationwide opioid prescriptions declined 18 percent between 2010 and 2015, the rate of overdoses sharply increased from 12.3 per 100,000 population in 2010 to 16.3 in 2015.\n",
      "The decrease in prescriptions was driven by efforts of the Obama administration, the Office of National Drug Control, the Drug Enforcement Administration and several state governments to reduce opioid misuse and perceived over-prescribing through greater enforcement, stricter rules and prosecutions of doctors and pharmacists, according to the Drug Policy Alliance.\n",
      "Rather than saving lives, many who were using prescription opioids turned to to drugs like heroin, which, because of its illegality, is often highly variable in purity and which is often cut with other, more pot\n",

      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Americans are dying at a rate of 91 per day from opioid overdoses. A principal driver of these deaths is illicitly manufactured fentanyl that is 50 to 100 times more potent than heroin, and carfentanil, which is 1,000 times more potent than heroin.\n",
      "There were 62,000 opioid overdose deaths in 2016; drug overdose deaths have surpassed peak death counts of guns, HIV, and car accidents.

      "Despite their name, ice giants are actually hot as heck. Sure, temperatures in the upper atmosphere hover hundreds of degrees Fahrenheit below zero, thanks to the planets' distance from the sun. But as you approach the core, the immense pressure crushing the interior heats things up thousands of degrees. These balmy temps and crushing pressures could theoretically prime hydrogen and carbon to form diamond rain some 5,000 miles below the outer surface of the atmosphere.\n",
      "\"Previously, researchers could only assume that the diamonds had formed, \" Dominik Kraus, scientist at Helmholtz Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf and lead author of a study on the results, said in a statement . \"When I saw the results of this latest experiment, it was one of the best moments of my scientific career.\"\n",
      "When subjected to the pressures (and temperatures) of life on other planets, even familiar substances can get pretty alien. Case in point: the diamond rains of the ice giants. Scientists have long thought that massive planets like Neptune and Uranus — which contain relatively tiny rocky cores covered with a mantle of slurried water, ammonia, and methane ices and surrounded by a thick atmosphere — are subject to rain made of literal diamonds. Now researchers have synthesized the process in a lab, showing how such conditions might occur.\n",
      "To replicate the process, scientists had to make some (very) hot and (very) heavy conditions. They used an intense laser to send a pair of overlapping shockwaves through polystryene — a plastic, made from hydrogen and carbon, that can simulate the behavior of methane compounds. The shockwaves created a brief moment of pressure and heat comparable to everyday life in an ice giant's interior.\n",
      "\"The experimental time is very short, \" Kraus told The Guardian. \"That we saw this very clear signature of diamonds was actually very, very surprising.\"\n",

      "The fund has $175 million in its war chest to fund AI startups that arise within its walls. Rather than bring in outside startups and provide them with funding, Ng's vision is to have small teams working on projects that can evolve into larger companies. It's similar to what he did at Baidu, where he led the Chinese search giant's artificial intelligence efforts.\n",

The fund has some big name backers, including Greylock Partners, New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Sequoia Capital, and SoftBank Group.\n",
      "The AI Fund currently has several teams investigating a number of problem spaces. Ng didn't disclose how many teams there are or the areas they're working in, but privacy is one of the proposed benefits of the fund. Rather than asking teams to spend time showing their products to investors and other members of the public, the incubator enables them to work in relative stealth until they're ready.\n",

      "\"It's another example of him being out of control, \" said Wolff. \"I know that everybody was trying to stop him from doing this. He couldn't be stopped. His head had exploded, so he did what no president has ever done: attempt to sue someone for defamation and invasion of privacy.\"\n",

The other side, is this guy is a complete fool. All he managed to do was call more attention to my book. He just shoots himself in the foot at every opportunity.\"\n",
      "With regard to Trump's mental fitness and capability of carrying out his duties, Wolff said, \"I don't know if the president is clinically off his rocker. I do know, from what I saw and what I heard from people around him, that Donald Trump is deeply unpredictable, irrational, at times bordering on incoherent, self-obsessed in a disconcerting way, and displays all those kinds of traits that anyone would reasonably say, 'What's going on here, is something wrong?'\"\n",

      "A panel of federal judges struck down North Carolina's congressional map on Tuesday, condemning it as unconstitutional because Republicans had drawn the map seeking a political advantage.\n",
      "The ruling was the first time that a federal court had blocked a congressional map because of a partisan gerrymander, and it instantly endangered Republican seats in the coming elections.\n",
      "Judge James A. Wynn Jr., in a biting 191-page opinion, said that Republicans in North Carolina's Legislature had been \"motivated by invidious partisan intent\" as they carried out their obligation in 2016 to divide the state into 13 congressional districts, 10 of which are held by Republicans. The result, Judge Wynn wrote, violated the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection.\n",
      "The ruling and its chief demand — that the Republican-dominated Legislature create a new landscape of congressional districts by Jan. 24 — infused new turmoil into the political chaos that has in recent years enveloped North Carolina. President Trump carried North Carolina in 2016, but the state elected a Democrat as its governor on the same day and in 2008 supported President Barack Obama.\n",
      "The unusually blunt decision by the panel could lend momentum to two other challenges on gerrymandering that are already before the Supreme Court — and that the North Carolina case could join if Republicans make good on their vow to appeal Tuesday's ruling.\n",
      "In October, the court heard an appeal of another three-judge panel's ruling that Republicans had unconstitutionally gerrymandered Wisconsin's State Assembly in an attempt to relegate Democrats to a permanent minority. In the second case , the justices will hear arguments by Maryland R\n"

      "AUSTIN — President Donald Trump's now disbanded voter fraud commission sought voter records from Texas state officials that flagged Hispanic voters, The Washington Post reported Monday .\n",
      "The commission's request seeking categories such as full names, addresses, dates of birth, political party affiliation, last four digits of Social Security numbers and voter history since 2006 had rattled voting rights groups in Texas, who feared the commission would use its stated mission of investigating voter fraud to restrict the voting rights of minorities.\n",
      "The information was never released to the commission. A lawsuit by minority and voting rights groups stopped the state from releasing nearly 50 million voting records that spanned from 2006 to 2016. The lawsuit is pending a resolution after the disbanding of the commission.\n",
      "\"The request from the commission was inappropriate to begin with, and it was inappropriate for Texas to have contemplated giving the data given their state privacy laws and the inability of the commission to protect voters' privacy, \" said Myrna Perez, a lawyer for the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University who represents the plaintiffs in the case. \"It's one of the many reasons why Texas voters would have been subject to unreasonable and unlawful privacy risks.\"\n",
      "Texas plaintiffs still fear exposure of voter data even with Trump's fraud commission dissolved\n",
      "Kris Kobach, the vice chairman of the controversial commission, told The Post the request to flag Hispanic voters was a \"complete surprise\" and that the commission never asked any state to flag surnames by ethnicity or race.\n",
      "But documents filed with the Texas Secretary of State show that Ron Williams, the man in charge of collecting information from the states for the commission, checked boxes to flag Hispanic surnames on his request forms.\n",

      "The last time North Carolina Republicans redrew the state's 13 congressional districts, they made absolutely no secret of their ambition to rig the system and lock in a 10-3 balance in their favour — regardless of whether they or the Democrats won a majority of the votes in future elections.\n",
      "\"I think electing Republicans is better than electing Democrats, \" bragged the chair of the redistricting committee in the state general assembly, David Lewis. \"So I drew this map to help foster what I think is better for the country.\"\n",

      "The instruction from Lewis and his colleagues, according to court documents, was \"to create as many districts as possible in which GOP candidates would be able to successfully compete for office\".\n",
      "That was in 2016, when the prevailing wisdom across the US was that partisan gerrymandering was one of the legitimate spoils of American politics. Up to that point, the courts had punished gerrymandering along racial lines — one North Carolina map from the 1990s that packed black voters into the fewest possible districts was memorably likened to \"political apartheid\" — but raised little or no objection to state maps that favored one party over another.\n",
      "That may be about to change dramatically, in the wake of a bombshell ruling from a federal court in North Carolina last week that found the 2016 redistricting plan to be a violation of both the constitution's equal protection clause and an infringement on the free speech of voters who cannot meaningfully cast a ballot if the outcome is all but predetermined.\n",

      "WASHINGTON — Pennsylvania's congressional district map is a partisan gerrymander that \"clearly, plainly and palpably\" violates the state's Constitution , the State Supreme Court said on Monday, adding to a string of court decisions striking down political maps that unduly favor one political party.\n",
      "The court banned the current map of the state's 18 House districts from being used in this year's primary and general elections, and ordered that a new map be submitted to the court by Feb. 15. But the state's Republican-dominated Legislature, which approved the current map in 2011, has already said it would try to overturn such a decision in federal court. That would set up another legal battle over gerrymanders in a year already filled with them.\n",
      "But an appeal to the federal courts would very likely fail, election experts said, because decisions based solely on interpretations of state law — as this one appears to be — are generally beyond the reach of federal judges.\n",
      "For the same reason, the state court's decision has no direct bearing on a string of challenges to partisan gerrymanders that are already moving through the federal court system. Earlier this month, in fact, a divided panel of three federal judges left intact the same Pennsylvania House map that the state court threw out on Monday.\n",
      "If the state court ruling stands and the map is redrawn, the consequences could be serious for Republicans, who are already battling national political headwinds in their effort to maintain control of the House in the midterm elections this fall.\n",

      "(CNN) Rural Indians, who make up about two-thirds of the country of 1.3 billion people, are disproportionately at risk of breathing polluted air, according to new research.\n",
      "India's air pollution has been making headlines for years, with attention focused on Delhi, the capital, once named the most polluted city in the world by the World Health Organization.\n",
      "Yet research published Thursday by an international team of scientists, including experts from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay and the Health Effects Institute, estimates that 75% of air pollution-related deaths in India during 2015 came in its rural areas.\n",
      "\"Air pollution is a national, pan-India problem. It's not limited to urban centers and megacities, and it disproportionately affects rural Indians more than urban Indians, \" said Chandra Venkataraman, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, who was a member of the working group that conducted the study.\n",
      "The study found that exposure to the smallest and most dangerous airborne pollution particles, known as PM2.5, was roughly equal across rural and urban India. Part of the reason for the higher proportion of deaths in rural areas, though, is that about two-thirds of the population still lives there rather than in cities, the scientists say.\n",
      "The findings are the result of a comprehensive, state-by-state analysis of the sources of air pollution and what impact it has had on health in India.\n",
      "\"This put all the pieces together, \" said Milind Kandlikar, a professor who studies air pollution at the University of British Columbia. He was not involved with the new research. \"It moves from sources to human health effects. And it does this across the entire country.\"\n",
      "In 2015, over a million deaths could be attributed to air pollution in India, the study says: about 25% of the total deaths linked to air pollution around the globe.\n",

      "One question about the resignation of Charlotte 49ers' athletic director Judy Rose: If she knew last summer that she was going to leave, why did she fire basketball coach Mark Price in mid-December? This one doesn't fit. If you're know you're out, why contribute to the mess your predecessor will inherit?\n",

      "But Charlotte the school has lost Charlotte the city, and she was in the middle of it. Fans are owed a reason to drive to campus for football and basketball games, and Rose ceased to give them one. Rose trusts her instincts when she hires a head coach, and gambles on candidates that lack head coaching experience. Her instincts have betrayed her.\n",

      "A home was destroyed by a fire northeast of Duluth on Sunday morning.\n",
      "Fire crews battled the flames — and subzero conditions — at 1713 Hegberg Road, in Duluth Township about 20 miles northeast of the city of Duluth. Thick smoke billowed across the road and could be seen from several miles away.\n",
      "The St. Louis County Sheriff's Office reported that the fire was quickly contained after it began at 10 a.m. Sunday, but the structure was considered a total loss. The home was valued at $300,000. No one was home at the time of the fire, but two dogs were inside the home, according to the Sheriff's Office. The cause of the fire is under investigation.\n",
      "Fire crews from Clifton, Normanna, Two Harbors, Lakewood, Rice Lake, Gnesen, Fredenberg, the 148th Fighter Wing and Canosia responded to the fire, as well as St. Louis County Public Works plow crews and Two Harbors Ambulance.\n",
      "Temperatures were in the single digits below zero, with wind chills in the 20s and 30s below zero.\n",

      "FRANKFURT — Three major German carmakers that financed the researchers who used monkeys to test the health effects of diesel exhaust struggled to contain harsh criticism from animal rights activists and a wave of negative media coverage after details of the tests emerged.\n",
      "News of the research — reported by The New York Times on Thursday and portrayed by an episode of the documentary \" Dirty Money \" that began airing on Netflix on Friday — quickly developed into a public relations disaster for the companies: Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW. It is also likely to intensify a backlash against diesel in Europe, where, until recently, it was the most popular engine option.\n",
      "The research was intended to show that modern diesel technology had solved the problem of excess emissions linked to a range of lung ailments and blamed for tens of thousands of premature deaths. Instead, it has shed unwelcome light on the methods that the carmakers had used to influence political debate.\n",

      "The experiments — carried out in 2014, a year before Volkswagen was caught using software to cloak excess diesel emissions — involved exposing a group of monkeys to exhaust from a late-model diesel Volkswagen, while another group was exposed to exhaust from an older Ford diesel pickup. After breathing diluted exhaust for four hours, the monkeys were examined and researchers took samples of lung tissue to check for inflammation. The research did not kill the monkeys, but it was unclear what hap\n"

      "The three taken into custody were passengers in the SUV when it attempted to make its way onto the NSA compound just after 7 a.m., Gordon Johnson, Special Agent in Charge at the FBI Baltimore Office, said in an afternoon news conference.\n",
      "The SUV, which had a New York license plate, appeared to be a rental car, Johnson said. He added that the incident was not linked to terrorism and there's an ongoing investigation.\n",
