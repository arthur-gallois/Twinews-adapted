      "Ever since the recent wave of protests in Iran began on December 28, Western media coverage has disproportionately focused on socioeconomic causes as the main drivers behind citizens' anger. Economic hardship is undeniably a key root cause, but to ignore the underlying political grievances is to lose sight of the bigger fight for the country's future. Although Iranian President Hassan Rouhani may be neither the primary target nor the proximate cause of the demonstrations, his record in office since winning reelection last May has been an enormous disappointment to the nearly 24 million Iranians who voted for his second term. Instead of seeking to be his own man, Rouhani has repeatedly fallen back into following the playbook of the unelected Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, widening the already dangerous disconnect between ordinary Iranians and the ruling Shiite Islamist elite that purports to represent them. Nothing short of major reform can save the Islamic Republic in the long term.\n",
      "Despite his portrayal in some Western media outlets, Rouhani has never called himself a political reformer nor has the Iranian public ever considered him to be one. His election victory had less to do with his own popularity than with the unpopularity of his hard-liner opponent, Ibrahim Raisi. Over the course of the campaign, however, Rouhani made a key pledge that stuck with voters: citizens would gain greater political freedom were he reelected. In his second term, he said, his government would belong to \"100 percent of all Iranians\" and he would seek to open the path for political participation for youth, women, and ethnic and religious minorities. And he again vowed to seek the release of opposition leaders under house arrest since 2011, a pledge he first made before his initial election in 2013. Overpromising during an election year is not unique to Iran, but in the case of Rouhani the gap between slogans and reality has been dazzling.\n",
      "The disappointment began at his first press conference after reelection. Unduly cautious and uninspiring, Rouhani chose not\n",

      "Swedish journalist and strategic analyst Bertil Lintner has spent most of his career in Asia, writing about India and China and mapping the increasingly contested region the two countries share. His book, 'China's India War: Collision Course on the Roof of the World', has just been published. Here he speaks about the challenge to India from China in South Asia, his research on the 1962 war, and why he thinks there will not be another India-China war, even as India firms its counter-alliance in the Indo-Pacific. Excerpts\n",
      "Your latest book on the 1962 war challenges the idea that India triggered it, and its title \"China's India War\" counters Neville Maxwell's account called \"India's China War\".\n",
      "You can say that all the books on the 1962 war fall into [different] categories. The first by Indian military officers who served during the war, and they are essentially military histories about how the battles were fought and so on. But they don't give the geopolitical context. The second is the category of scholarly books on the border dispute. Now here it is important to remember the difference in political culture between India and China. India has a strong legalistic approach, with courts and laws being very important. China, on the other hand, dismisses all treaties that it doesn't like by calling them 'unequal treaties' which were imposed on China when China was weak. But even in more modern days, when China is strong, these treaties mean nothing.\n",
      "Also Read Myth and reality in India-China relations\n",
      "Recently, the Chinese foreign ministry said that the treaty with Britain over Hong Kong was now history, or that the international court ruling on the South China Sea favouring the Philippines was just an unfair judgment. And as I point out in the book, while India was preparing White Papers and documentation and maps and copies of treaties on the boundary, China was preparing for war.\n",
      "As early as 1959, you say in the book...\n",
      "Yes, and the reason that people like Maxwell and others thought it was India's forward policy that provoked the war was because China was a very closed society in those days. People were not even aware at the time that tens of millions of people had died in a famine in China as a result of the Great Leap Forward, and there was a crisis within the Communist Party. Mao Zedong was at his least popular moment in 1949 and Mao needed to unite the party and the country behind himself. India was a convenient enemy because the Dalai Lama had been given refuge here in 1959. The other reason was that in the 1950s, India under Jawaharlal Nehru had become the main voice for newly independent countries in Asia and Africa. India initiated the Non-Aligned Movement, gave the language of Panchsheel. Now at the time, the West's three-world theory saw the Western Bloc, the Eastern Bloc, and the global South (underdeveloped world). The Chinese view of the world was the superpowers, the lesser powers, and the poor countries (Third World). China wanted to become the leader of the revolutionary forces in the Third World and had to dethrone India from that position. After the war, Mao became strong enough to begin the cultural war, and Nehru, who died a broken man two years later, was no longer able to lead India as a spokesman of the Third World and Asia.\n",
      "You've written about the roles of the Soviet Union and the U.S. as key to the outcome in 1962. In a war-like situation between India and China today, what position would the U.S. and Russia take?\n",
      "Well, first of all, I don't think there is going to be a war between India and China today. Trade is too important. I think what we're seeing today is a new Cold War in Asia, an informal alliance between India and Japan [versus China]. The United States is a bit unpredictable under Donald Trump, but it had under Barack Obama embarked on a pivot to Asia, with the rise of China as the main concern. For the first time, since the 15th century and Admiral Zheng He, the Chinese are now in the Indian Ocean. China didn't even have a proper navy until recently. So now when it talks of One Belt One Road, and the ancient maritime trade routes, it must be remembered it's not so ancient. In the Indian Ocean, you have India, which considers it its own lake, as it were. But also in the Indian Ocean is the U.S.'s most important base, Diego Garcia. And the French control 2.5 million acres of land in the Indian Ocean. This is why these alliances are growing.\n",
      "To come back to the land boundary, you have said that the Doklam stand-off this year was not about China's designs on India, but aimed to drive a wedge between India and Bhutan. Why do you say that?\n",
      "Bhutan is China's only neighbour that doesn't have diplomatic ties with it. Relations are maintained through these boundary talks, which have been going on for more than two decades. Bhutan has been under Indian influence, but it is now asserting itself as a sovereign power. Why did China even need the road in Doklam? Maybe the plan was to get Indian troops out of Haa (Bhutan's Haa Valley) and get them more directly involved in this conflict, which would embarrass many Bhutanese. You can see the statements from Bhutan at the time, which were very cautious, and many Bhutanese think that India overreacted and wanted to show its control over Bhutan. China is on a charm offensive there (in Bhutan). They're sending acrobats there, circus performers, football teams, tourists, scholarships for students. Clearly China wants to extend its influence to all its neighbours, and that includes Bhutan.\n",
      "What does this mean for India-China relations in the future, especially the resolution of the boundary question?\n",
      "I think the Indian Ocean is going to become the biggest challenge in the near future. I find it hard to believe they will fight another war in the Himalayas. China has in the past suggested a swap between Arunachal/South Tibet and Aksai Chin. On paper that sounds reasonable, but we don't know how serious the Chinese are. Also, if China were to accept the Line of Actual Control (LAC) as the border, it could control any dissidence within. In India, which is a democracy, the government couldn't just go ahead with that solution... it would be political suicide. So this package is a non-starter. But in the larger picture, China doesn't care if the boundary remains unresolved. They are not looking for a solution, they are looking for a strategic advantage. Where there is a conflict of interest building up is in the Indian Ocean. And the joint naval exercises with Australia and other countries is important. While visiting the Andaman Islands recently, I was told that the U.S. navy was visiting Port Blair. Now we know that they are not there to learn to rescue shipwrecks and play cricket.\n",
      "Do you see the newly convened \"Quad\", of India, Australia, Japan and the U.S., building up as a military alliance?\n",
      "Yes, I think so. It is almost inevitable. Nobody really wants to talk about it, but it will come. It has to do with the rise of China, and with economic power will come political power and then military power, which you need to protect your interests.\n",
      "In your previous book, 'Great Game East', you dealt with China's inroads in the Indian subcontinent, from Myanmar to the Maldives. The Maldives has recently concluded a free trade agreement with China, and is growing much closer to Beijing in all respects. The question is, how can India counter China's obvious advantage in terms of money power?\n",
      "Well so far, India has been an observer, and not done that much really. The same thing is happening in the Seychelles. China is paying enormous attention to the country, of less than 100,000 people. India's eastern border with Myanmar is so much more important, for example. But India spends an inordinate time on its western border (with Pakistan). Myanmar is China's corridor to the Indian Ocean. What India can do to counter it is to pay more attention.\n",
      "Do you think India's position on the Belt and Road Initiative, which every neighbour except Bhutan has joined, will be effective or counter-productive?\n",
      "I think on the Belt and Road Initiative, India should have made its opposition to it much earlier, and articulated its concerns better, because they were lost on most outside observers.\n",
      "Will the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) change the politics of the region?\n",
      "So far, I don't think the CPEC has been much of a success. Pakistan is not a stable country, and China will have to deal more and more with its internal dynamics. Plus, the CPEC connects to Xinjiang, away from China's economic centres, unlike, say, Myanmar that connects to China's eastern economic zones and ports. Over the past year, given the problems in Rakhine state, China is even looking for a third route into the Indian Ocean to bypass the choke-point at the Strait of Malacca. Here China is pushing the idea of the Kra Canal (from Gulf of Thailand to the Andaman Sea). So for China what is important is the goal, not so much the routes to it.\n",
      "Moving to the east, is China's control in Myanmar inevitable, or is there something India can do?\n",
      "India has three main problems on its boundary with Myanmar compared to China. The first is infrastructure. On Myanmar's northern border, China has super-highways, an airport not far from the border. Kunming has been upgraded to a huge international airport. On the Indian side, infrastructure is still a major problem. It's better than 10 years ago perhaps, but not comparable to what already exists on the Chinese side.\n",
      "The other problem is red-tape and bureaucracy, and it seems that the Chinese Communist Party are better capitalists than India, a democracy, is. There are still many trade restrictions on the Indian side and several checkpoints. An integrated checkpoint, which is being planned by India, will help. The third problem is from underground rebel groups operating on the Indian side, which can carry out attacks and extort money all along the border. Anyone with a gun can demand anything. But I can say with certainty that people of Myanmar would like to do much more trade with India, because the dependence on China is so massive, it is worrying for everyone, including their military.\n"

      "The City Council placed several members receptive to business interests in key positions of power Thursday.\n",
      "New Speaker Corey Johnson picked out a number of his centrist, establishment colleagues to oversee the council's most influential committees. Johnson and the council remain overwhelmingly Democratic and left-wing, but the pragmatic outer-borough political operations that orchestrated Johnson's rise clearly shaped many of his decisions about which of his peers to place in leadership roles.\n",
      "Bronx Councilman Rafael Salamanca, a moderate Democrat who has ties to figures in the affordable housing industry, will chair the powerful Committee on Land Use — which must sign off on every project requiring a zoning change or variance, or the disposition of public property, as well as on all landmarking decisions.\n",
      "article continues below advertisement\n",
      "The other big prize, the budget-negotiating Committee on Finance, will go to liberal Queens Councilman Daniel Dromm, but other committees with influence on private-sector affairs went to more conservative members.\n",
      "Johnson installed Bronx Councilman Mark Gjonaj, who formerly worked in real estate, atop the Committee on Small Business and gave Queens Councilman Paul Vallone, one of the most conservative Democrats in the five boroughs, the chairmanship of the Committee on Economic Development.\n",
      "Another right-of-center Democrat, Councilman Ruben Diaz Sr. of the Bronx, will head a new Committee on For-Hire Vehicles. This will take oversight of the taxi industry and of e-hail apps out of the purview of the Committee on Transportation, a blow to its continuing chairman, taxi-friendly Manhattan Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez. Rodriguez was a key ally of Mayor Bill de Blasio in his efforts to rein in the Central Park horse carriage industry and to regulate Uber.\n",
      "In a conciliatory gesture, Johnson gave Brooklyn Councilman Robert Cornegy, a rival for the speakership and an advocate for small business, leadership of the important Committee on Housing. And Brooklyn Councilman Rafael Espinal, who spearheaded the repeal of the city's cabaret law — which obligated bars and clubs to obtain a permit before allowing dancing — and the creation of the new Office of Nightlife, saw his Committee on Consumer Affairs expanded to also cover business licensing.\n",
      "Brooklyn Councilman Brad Lander, the chief theoretician of the body's progressive wing under previous Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and architect of a slew of regulations passed from 2014 through 2017, will keep his post as deputy leader for policy. But sources suggested this was thanks to the influence of Lander's allies in organized labor, particularly the Service Employees International Union, and argued that he would have little sway in the next four years.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Johnson made the rare bipartisan move of giving a committee chairmanship to a Republican: Councilman Joseph Borelli of Staten Island will helm Fire and Emergency Management.\n",
      "Other than Finance and Land Use and their subcommittees, the council's internal panels possess few powers other than passing legislation and pressuring agency leaders to testify at public hearings. But Johnson signaled his further independence from de Blasio by appointing Bronx Councilman Ritchie Torres to an overhauled Committee on Oversight and Investigations, which will have an enhanced budget and a staff of professional auditors and researchers to conduct probes into malfeasance and failures within city government.\n",

      "The Brazil midfielder almost quit football at the age of 19, was written off after leaving Tottenham for China in 2015 but is now preparing for his first clasico having silenced his critics at Barcelona\n",
      "\"I told him I didn't want to play any more. He was phoning and phoning but I said: 'I'm not going to play.'\" The calls came, the president on the line, but Jose Paulo Bezerra Maciel Junior — better known as Paulinho, hardly known at all then — had made up his mind. He had headed home to Sao Paulo, yet rather than returning to his boyhood club he was giving up on the game. He had had enough, aged 19. \"In Lithuania they had racially abused me, in Poland they hadn't paid me, and I thought: 'I don't need this,'\" he says. \"I said to my family: 'I'm not playing football again.'\"\n",
      "Which was when his then-wife intervened, telling him to think about his parents — a council worker and a supermarket manager who had supported him since he started playing at the age of five. Ditching it all would, she said, show a lack of respect to them. Paulinho and his wife had just had a baby daughter too and, besides, she asked: 'What else can you do?' It is a good question. What would he have done? Paulinho smiles. \"I really don't know, \" he says. \"She said: 'The only thing you know how to do is play football.'\" And so that is what he did.\n",
      "Atletico Madrid report Barcelona to Fifa over Antoine Griezmann approach Read more\n",
      "However the \"then\" Paulinho is talking about is not 2008, it is 2015. It is not that he gave up once a long time ago; it is that others routinely gave up on him. He tells his story steadily, dating every decision. \"It's been a rollercoaster, \" he says. He has played in six countries in three continents, been a Copa Libertadores champion and relegated too, suffered the greatest humiliation in Brazil's history and been abused, unpaid, written off. And now look.\n",
      "Paulinho's professional career began when, aged 16, he left home for Lithuania; it ended aged 26 when he left London for China. Or at least it was supposed to, Guangzhou his particular graveyard. \"When I went, everyone said that was it: my career was over, \" Paulinho says. The question is simple: why go? The answer is simple, stark too: there was a prospect worse — staying at Tottenham.\n",
      "After a year at Vilnius, Paulinho left for Lodz, returning to Brazil in the summer of 2008. He won promotion with Pao de Acucar before joining Bragantino in the second division. From there he headed to Corinthians, where he won the Brazilian title, the Libertadores and the Club World Cup. Having turned down Internazionale, he joined Tottenham the following year for a club-record £17m. The Premier League should have suited him, he admits, but within two years he was desperate to go. \"I wouldn't say it was a relief to leave Spurs but it was clear I had to, \" he says. \"It was a difficult time.\n",
      "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Paulinho is the highest-scoring midfielder in Spain going into Saturday's clasico. Photograph: Albert Gea/Reuters\n",
      "\"[Andre] Villas-Boas bought me in July 2013 and in December Villas-Boas goes. He'd wanted me, we'd spoken a lot, and then six months later Tim Sherwood was in charge. There was no problem with him — he was very young, a good coach — but the team wasn't doing well and he came under pressure to change things. He did things a little differently but I still played the last eight or nine games that season. Then came the change from Sherwood to Mauricio Pochettino.\"\n",
      "Something else came too. As Paulinho sets the scene, Belo Horizonte comes into view. He was brought on at half-time in the semi-final of the 2014 World Cup with the hosts 5-0 down to Germany and, as he discusses his return to Spurs afterwards, it is clear how much of an impact Brazil's 7-1 defeat had. \"The problem was that this came after the World Cup, with me trying to get back to some normality. I was the last back and to have gone out of the World Cup that way with Brazil at home ...\" he says pausing, his train of thought lost a little.\n",
      "\"I've never talked much about that game: maybe once or twice, that's it. There's no point. You can lose a game by two or three and say: 'Oh we made this mistake, we made that mistake, we lost.' But if you lose 7-1 what can you say? It is something that can't happen. But it happened. And after that, I had to go back to my club. You have a full season ahead of you when [you hope] you can recover from losing a World Cup semi-final 7-1 at home.\"\n",
      "It did not work out that way. Paulinho had started 28 league games in his first season in north London; in his second it was three. \"My first game [under Pochettino] is in my position but after that I played in every position apart from my own, \" Paulinho says, marking out roles with his fingers. \"If we play in a three, I'm here. If we play in a two, I'm here. \"He had a different system, and if you're not in your position in a football as competitive as England it's difficult.\n",
      "\"I was playing on the left wing: the mister put me there and I had to play there, because I wanted to play. I had no problem with Pochettino. I told him: 'This position is not mine but if you want I can play there.' But in the long term you're not going to be at your best and over the last six months I wasn't playing regularly.\n",
      "I'm not going to say bad things about England just because I had a bad time\n",
      "\"I thought the moment had come to leave. Where? I didn't know. But I wanted to leave. The coach wasn't trusting in me so there's no reason to stay. It was April, May 2015, a month left. I'd spoken to the president [chairman Daniel Levy] and asked him if he could help. He was a buenisimo person and he said: 'Let's wait and see if you have anything.'\"\n",
      "What he had was China. And that was pretty much that. \"There were two more offers in Europe but they were loans and I didn't want that, \" Paulinho says. Luiz Felipe Scolari wanted him at Guangzhou so he left London behind, not returning until the international friendly at Wembley last month. He says he went without bitterness. \"I'm not going to say bad things about England just because I had a bad time; it was a pleasure to play the Spurs players recently. I speak to Kyle Walker sometimes and it was nice to see Danny Rose and Eric Dier.\"\n",
      "Going to China is where the story is supposed to end. Although Paulinho insists he has not got a bad word for Guangzhou, a city of more than 13 million people that he describes as \"perfect\", he knew there was a risk, as if his career no longer counted. Was the football there too easy? Did the players actually care? It is tempting to see players as complicit in their own demise but his case contradicts that. China turned out to be a restart.\n",
      "How Paulinho turned his career around to earn a dream move to Barcelona | John Duerden Read more\n",
      "\"It's not the same, \" he concedes. \"The level didn't compare with Spain, Italy, England, Germany; it's totally different. But in 2016 more players arrived: Gervinho, [Ezequiel] Lavezzi, Jackson Martinez — then Oscar and Hulk arrived and the league grew. There are new laws making it more difficult to buy players and another one obliging teams to have three under-23s, so I imagine it will drop again a little, but the standard rose after 2015.\n",
      "\"It's not top, top, top but there are games that are very physical and teams like Guangzhou and Shanghai who have very good Chinese players and foreign signings. We had eight or nine Chinese national team players. And as a player, the motivation is the same because it comes from [within] you, whether you're in front of 4,000, 5,000 or 100,000. I also had the national team to play for.\"\n",
      "Six titles followed, including the Asian Champions League. Tite, the national coach, managed him at Corinthians and believed in him but still: he was in China. And yet Brazil did call — and so, unexpectedly, did Barcelona. Paulinho was preparing to take a free-kick when Brazil were facing Argentina and Lionel Messi sidled up. \"Are you coming to Barcelona?\" he asked. \"If you're taking me, I'm going, \" Paulinho replied before telling Willian to take the free kick: his head had gone.\n",
      "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Paulinho spent two seasons at Guangzhou after failing to make an impact at Tottenham. Photograph: VCG via Getty Images\n",
      "\"My representative called. My attitude was: 'When you have something concrete, let's sit down and decide, [but] I don't need anything crazy in my career right now.' I had three or four years' contract left. I was clear: either I go to Barcelona, or I stay, nothing else. We were in the knockout phase of the Asian Champions League and Scolari wanted to keep me but he knew it was a unique opportunity. I'm 29, it's Barcelona. I kept saying that to him: 'This is Barcelona. We're not talking about any club here: this one, that one, the other. No, we're talking about Barcelona.'\"\n",
      "Guangzhou resisted and Barcelona had to pay his full buyout clause on the final day of the Chinese market. Supporters were furious — not so much in Guangzhou as in Catalonia. In the wake of Neymar's departure, Barcelona were in the midst of a crisis, the catalogue of mistakes and problems growing, and some saw Paulinho's signing as the culmination — definitive 'proof' the club was adrift and the board incompetent.\n",
      "Few came to his presentation and much was made of a miscontrol as he performed the obligatory kick-ups. It was as if he symbolised everything that was wrong. €40m. For a 29-year-old. From China. Who failed at Spurs. And who did not fit the Barcelona model.\n",
      "That, though, was part of the point, while he also admits that he has talked often with team-mates about the way Barcelona play — especially with Messi, Sergio Busquets and Luis Suarez. \"We didn't have a player of his profile, \" the coach, Ernesto Valverde, said. \"He has important technical and physical qualities. He arrives in the area from deep; we needed someone who breaks through lines.\" Paulinho says: \"I've always been this kind of player: since youth level I've been a midfielder who can arrive and finish. I've almost never played in Busquets' position. My way of playing is similar to Lampard.\"\n",
      "Under Valverde, Barcelona remain unbeaten in 24 matches across all competitions and Paulinho has played his part. After his first start, in which he scored one and provided an assist, the Brazilian Football Federation joked: \"Is he bad?\"; Dani Alves suggested Paulinho would end up proving \"cheap\". He has six goals and two assists in the league. His name has been chanted at the Camp Nou. \"I'm happy I'm playing well and helping, \" he says. \"I didn't expect things to go so well.\n",
      "\"I've heard it said that I'm silencing the critics so many times but it's not that: I don't have to prove myself to anyone. I don't play for the critics, I play for my team-mates. For three, four years I haven't listened to anything, \" he says, sounding rather like he might have done. \"People always talk and always will. 'He's good now because he's at Barca', 'He was only good then because he was in China', blah, blah, blah. When I was at Bragantino and I went to Corinthians it was the same; it was the same at Tottenham and in China. I've had that since the beginning.\"\n",
      "Paulinho once again reflects on the beginning of his career. \"It was hard leaving everything behind at only 17 but I went. And then after the problems with racism, having to fight to be paid, I didn't want to carry on. I was fighting for things that should have been my right. I wasn't asking for a lot, for something I wanted — just to be respected and paid.\n",
      "\"My family didn't have a lot but we were OK, we could live, so I thought: 'I don't need this.' It wasn't that I didn't like football but I didn't want to play any more. After a while they persuaded me. We laugh about it now: 'You see! Imagine if you'd stopped back then.' I've had a lot of experiences and I wouldn't change a thing. I went from there to Spurs and from Spurs to China, because I wanted to play. 2014 was a very difficult year; 2015 was hard too, with everyone talking: 'Bah, Paulinho's career is over.' Everyone said that was it; they said the level was no good, but I won six trophies and within a year I was back in the Brazil team. Now this. That's football. It was a rollercoaster; no one gave me a chance, but here I am.\"\n"

      "Lawmakers are bracing themselves for a lobbying onslaught.\n",
      "\"There's no question they're coming, \" Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, R-Edgefield, said of the lobbying effort at the State House. \"It's going to be pretty intense. It's probably going to be the most intensely lobbied issue that I've seen.\n",

      "Among Dominion's new lobbying hires is former S.C. Gov. Jim Hodges, a Democrat and senior adviser for McGuireWoods Consulting. That firm and Hodges have a history with Dominion. Hodges worked as a consultant for the utility when it bought SCANA's S.C. natural gas pipeline system in 2014. Also, Dominion chief executive Tom Farrell is a former lawyer for McGuireWoods.\n",
      "New to the State House lobby is Florida-based NextEra Energy, which has hired eight lobbyists, including veterans Harry Cato and Tommy Moore. Moore and Cato were S.C. lawmakers in 2007 when the Legislature passed a law that enabled SCANA to gamble on the nuclear expansion project with customers' money.\n",

      "NextEra — a Florida-based utility with no S.C. holdings and, until now, no presence in the S.C. State House — has hired eight lobbyists for the new legislative session.\n",
      "The utility, which has its eyes on buying SCANA and state-owned Santee Cooper, also is a founding member of the Palmetto Energy Coalition, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the arrangement.\n",
      "When it launched last fall, that group, led by former U.S. Rep. Gresham Barrett, R-Westminster, described itself vaguely. The group's website does not identify its members publicly.\n",
      "However, State House sources says NextEra is behind the Energy Coalition.\n",
      "Former U.S. Rep. Barrett did not return calls Friday requesting comment on his coalition and its membership. And Adam Temple, a public relations consultant working with Energy Coalition, also did not respond to emails asking whether the Energy Coalition is being bankrolled by NextEra.\n",
      "NextEra's chief spokesman Rob Gould replied in an email, \"Sorry, but we won't be offering any comment related to your questions.\"\n",
      "However, Barrett and the Energy Coalition are pushing lawmakers to sell Santee Cooper.\n",
      "The group also criticized Dominion's proposed buyout of SCANA within hours of its announcement, saying — correctly — that Dominion was offering less in refunds to customers than the money those customers have been charged.\n",
      "\"While today's announcement takes some steps in the right direction, it leaves much to be desired for thousands of South Carolina families struggling to pay rates for electricity they didn't and won't receive, \" the coalition wrote.\n",
      "The Energy Coalition also has done polling on the nuclear fiasco. For instance, the group has touted its early November online poll that found 76 percent of S.C. residents think it's a good idea to sell Santee Cooper.\n",
      "The veiled relationship between NextEra and PEC is not the first time the utility has been accused of lurking in the shadows to achieve its goals.\n",
      "In 2016 in Florida, for example, NextEra subsidiary Florida Power and Light backed a $26 million ballot measure designed, according to critics, to confuse voters and scuttle another ballot measure, put forth by the solar industry, to expand rooftop solar power.\n",
      "Selling the deal\n",
      "SCANA and Dominion are engaged in a massive marketing campaign to win support from the public.\n",
      "Consultants and lobbyists promoting the deal are using social media to share positive posts and feedback about Dominion or its offer.\n",
      "Dominion spokesman Chet Wade called it an education campaign to help S.C. residents, lawmakers and others understand what the deal means for customers.\n",
      "Dominion is pitching a $1,000 refund to SCE&G customers if the deal goes down. The deal requires approval from a handful of state and federal regulators, including the S.C. commission that regulates utilities.\n",
      "Wade also said Dominion has polled S.C. residents to see how much they know about the company's offer.\n",
      "Wayne Cockfield, a 68-year-old retiree from Florence, said he received a call Wednesday, asking leading questions in favor of the $14.6 billion merger.\n",
      "It is unclear who paid for that poll. However, Cockfield said the caller asked whether he supports or opposes Dominion's offer to buy SCANA.\n",
      "Cockfield thinks the offer is a sham and says he told the caller as much.\n",
      "Then, the caller asked whether Dominion's offer to refund SCE&G customers about $1,000 each for the failed nuclear project or its plans to cut SCE&G's electric bills for consumers by $7 a month would change his mind, Cockfield said.\n",
      "\"I've done some politics. I know what push polls are, \" said Cockfield, who has worked for pro-life causes. \"To me, it wasn't a real poll. It was a commercial. I don't think they give a hoot about my opinion.\"\n"

      "Jerry Van Dyke played a nightclub comic in the short-lived '60s sitcom \"Accidental Family.\" (NBC)\n",
      "He was the younger brother of a more famous performer, but it is perfectly possible that Jerry Van Dyke was the sibling whose work you knew or liked best.\n",
      "On and off television from the early 1960s to 2015, including eight seasons of \"Coach\" and a late-career recurring role on \"The Middle, \" Van Dyke, who died Friday at age 86, may have shared a name and DNA with the star of \"Bye, Bye, Birdie, \" \"Mary Poppins\" and, of course, \"The Dick Van Dyke Show.\"\n",
      "But he was an original, not a knock-off, funny and charming — funny and testy, later — in ways unmistakably his own.\n",
      "The Van Dykes hailed from Danville, Ill., in the rural Midwest, and compared to Dick's bright-eyed, polished persona, Jerry kept something of the country about him — he was a dropper of Gs, a user of \"ain't.\" His manner was softer than that of his older brother, sweet and sleepy and a little slow — boyish even when, in later years, his body had grown thick and creaky. Young and old, his comedy — much the same when he was being interviewed as when he was reading lines — was a tangle of unfinished sentences and abandoned thoughts, of enthusiasm tripping over hesitation.\n",
      "Van Dyke began as a comedian while still in high school. He twice won the All Air Force Talent Show and traveled with the institution's Tops in Blue entertainment unit. Such details, along with his propensity to sleepwalk, were adapted into his first acting job, in 1962, as a guest on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show, \" memorably playing Rob Petrie's shy, banjo-playing military-vet brother, Stacey. (It also gave him an opportunity, as other shows subsequently would, to perform bits of his stage act.)\n",
      "The young actor was reportedly offered and turned down the role of Gilligan on \"Gilligan's Island, \" which, after all, might have led to Bob Denver's career. The sitcom he did take, the short-lived reincarnation comedy \"My Mother the Car, \" whose name perfectly explains its premise, is sometimes used to characterize television at its nadir — at times by Van Dyke himself. (I say \"short-lived, \" but in the 1965-66 season, that was enough to produce 30 episodes.)\n",
      "In the 1960s, Van Dyke came on as a good-looking, clean-cut, second-tier leading man type upon whom bets were repeatedly cast. He had parts in movies, including John Wayne's \"McLintock!\"; hosted a summer-replacement celebrity game show, \"Picture This, \" in 1963; and the same year was a regular on \"The Judy Garland Show\" for its first 10 episodes. His notices for the Garland show were apparently bad, and he disappeared from the cast, but clips reveal him to be winning and natural — too natural for the time, possibly.\n",
      "After \"My Mother the Car, \" there was \"Accidental Family\" (1967), also short-lived, with the great Lois Nettleton, in which he played a nightclub comic and single father (again using his stage act). A show about a Las Vegas comedian may not have been the best fit, culturally, for the fall after the Summer of Love; it lasted only until January.\n",
      "For whatever reasons, nothing connected.\n",
      "In the 1970s and '80s, Van Dyke continued to work nightclubs and make television guest appearances — including two on \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show, \" on which he once again played an aspiring comedian and where he kissed his brother's former television wife. (It will be a slightly disturbing moment for some of you.)\n",
      "But it wasn't until ABC's \"Coach\" came along in 1989 that he found his defining, and longest-lasting role. As assistant football coach Luther Van Dam, a part written for him by series creator Barry Kemp and which offered Van Dyke plenty of space to bumble, he earned four Emmy nominations.\n",
      "That recognition came late, when he was already in his late 50s, did not bother him.\n",
      "\"You make it older, it's easier, because you [don't] have to worry — I'd probably have screwed it up anyway if I'd made it, \" he told David Letterman in 1994. \"But you make it as an older [person], then people know you as being older... If I'd had made it earlier, people would say, 'Look how old he's got.' So I was old going in. I want to be like Walter Brennan; no one ever said, 'Walter Brennan's gotten old.' He was born old.\"\n",
      "After \"Coach, \" he embraced old, playing fathers and grandfathers and eccentric duffers, as a guest or recurring player on series including \"Yes, Dear, \" \"Teen Angel, \" \"My Name Is Earl\" and \"Raising Hope.\" Best of all, and last of all, were his appearances on \"The Middle\" as Tag Spence, the father of Patricia Heaton's Frankie Heck.\n",
      "Marsha Mason played his wife, and, closing a circle, Dick Van Dyke appeared as Tag's estranged brother in the 2015 episode \"Two of a Kind\" — also the title of the song the Van Dykes sing under the closing credits.\n",
      "As a sentiment, it was sweet, and as a moment, moving. (It's Jerry's last performance, and the brothers' last work together.) But that title is misleading: There was Dick, and there was Jerry Van Dyke, and there was never any mistaking the two. Each was one of a kind.\n",

      "West Ham United are set to appoint David Moyes on an initial six-month contract and hand him the responsibility of hauling them away from relegation danger after finally losing faith in Slaven Bilic's ability to reverse the team's decline.\n",
      "The club hope the former Sunderland manager can take training as early as on Tuesday morning with Alan Irvine, Chris Woods and possibly Stuart Pearce joining him as part of his backroom staff. Moyes will be offered a fresh two-year deal if he keeps West Ham in the Premier League.\n",
      "Bilic, whose contract was due to run out next summer, was sacked on Monday morning after a dismal start to the season that has left West Ham in 18th place and with two wins from their first 11 Premier League games.\n",
      "While the club's owners, David Gold and David Sullivan, had hoped that giving the manager time would eventually pay off, Saturday's wretched 4-1 defeat by Liverpool at the London Stadium was the final straw. The Croat's assistants, Nikola Jurcevic, Edin Terzic, Julian Dicks and Miljenko Rak, have also left the club.\n",
      "Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend's action Read more\n",
      "Gold and Sullivan released a statement explaining that they felt compelled to act in the club's best interests after seeing few indications that Bilic was capable of reviving West Ham and added that they plan to appoint \"a quality manager to the position to inject fresh ideas, organisation and enthusiasm into a very talented squad\".\n",
      "That manager is Moyes, even though news of the 54-year-old's arrival on an interim basis has been met with opposition from supporters. The Scot has struggled since leaving Everton for Manchester United in 2013 — his last three jobs have ended in failure — and has been out of work since quitting Sunderland after their relegation from the Premier League last season.\n",

      "While his great contemporary Xavi said he wanted at least 100 touches of the ball per game, Pirlo was an entirely different animal. He embodied the regista position, orchestrating attacks with outrageous, long passes that were hit with unnerving accuracy. With his ability to spread perfectly weighted diagonal cross-field balls in behind opposing defenders, he was a full-back's dream. As Marcello Lippi, the man who managed Pirlo to a World Cup winners' medal, put it: \"Andrea was a silent leader. He let his feet do the talking.\"\n",
      "All the glowing tributes that have come forth since his retirement — from Zinedine Zidane to Gianluigi Buffon via Kaka and Gary Lineker — might never have been voiced had it not been for an old sage of Italian football, Carlo Mazzone. The Brescia manager was of the opinion that Pirlo, who had played his entire career to that point as a No10, was simply too slow in a game that was emphasising brawn over brain at the beginning of the 21st century. Already having Roberto Baggio on the books no doubt made Mazzone's decision to move Pirlo back 30 metres that much easier, but it was still a gamble.\n",
      "Golazos galore: the 25 best goals from the golden era of Serie A Read more\n",
      "Of course everyone remembers the goal; the touch of ridiculous genius from Baggio as he pulled the ball from the sky like he had hands for feet, but people forget that it was Pirlo who took out the entire Juventus defence with what would soon be his trademark: the floating through-ball from deep.\n",

      "China's new statement on economic priorities illustrates President Xi Jinping's growing clout, as well as a subtle shift in how the country may address its debt pile.CreditFred Dufour/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images\n",
      "SHANGHAI — It's Xi Jinping's economy now, and he isn't too worried about debt.\n",
      "China signaled its economic priorities on Wednesday at the end of a meeting of top Communist Party economic leaders with a statement indicating that President Xi is fully in charge. Labeled \"Xi Jinping Thought on Socialist Economy With Chinese Characteristics, \" the statement called for trimming industrial overcapacity, controlling the supply of money and other moves that have been staples of China's other recent declarations.\n",
      "Barely mentioned: China's surging debt. Despite downgrades this year by two international credit rating firms and warnings from institutions like the International Monetary Fund, the statement issued at the conclusion of the Central Economic Work Conference called for controlling borrowing by local governments, but it otherwise glossed over a vast borrowing splurge in recent years, driven in large part by Chinese companies.\n",
      "\"Prudent monetary policy should be kept neutral, the floodgates of monetary supply should be controlled, and credit and social financing should see reasonable growth, \" the statement said.\n",
      "The statement illustrates both Mr. Xi's growing clout and what economists say is a subtle shift in how China may address its debt pile — a shift that suggests leaders may be willing to tolerate even more debt if it will help growth.\n",
      "The label applied to the new statement echoes those used by past strong Chinese leaders like Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping and marks Mr. Xi's long ascent to become the Communist Party's unquestioned leader. Two months ago, the party lifted Mr. Xi to Mao's stature by enshrining \" Xi Jinping Thought. \"\n",

      "The state legislature might have more pressing issues, but when it convenes in February, legislators should pass a law making it clear to drivers that the left lane is for passing and turning left.\n",
      "\"Slower Traffic Keep Right\" signs already line hilly roads in Connecticut, but it's a good idea for drivers everywhere, whether on a steep hill or a flat interstate.\n",
      "Connecticut has an epidemic of left-lane lollygaggers, not only on its highways but on roads such as Route 44 west of Hartford and the Berlin Turnpike. Though many drivers complain about weavers who switch lanes to get around slower vehicles, the cause is often a car loitering in the left lane.\n",
      "Many states have laws restricting the left lanes of divided highways to vehicles that are passing traffic, and there's a good reason for it: The right-hand side of any vehicle has a larger blind spot. Passing a vehicle on the right is inherently more dangerous for all motorists.\n",
      "Connecticut law allows passing on the right only when there are three or more travel lanes, and Connecticut also forbids impeding traffic. But in more than 840,000 traffic stops from late 2013 to early 2015, not one single person was pulled over specifically for impeding traffic.\n",
      "Other states are more restrictive. Colorado, for example, prohibits traveling in the left lane of any highway where the speed limit is 65 or above. Illinois clearly states that \"a vehicle may not be driven in the left lane, except when overtaking and passing another vehicle.\"\n",
      "Legislators should pass a law that encourages drivers to keep right unless passing on all of Connecticut's roads. It's a universal \"rule of the road, \" but it needs to be spelled out, and enforcement needs to be stepped up.\n",

      "29-year-old defender Justin Davis began his professional career with Minnesota United in 2011 when the Loons were in the NASL. He made the jump with the club to MLS in 2017, starting out as United's first-choice left fullback. Davis lost his spot, however, and saw his minutes disappear in the second half of the season.\n",

      "Nashville are bringing another player with MLS ties in Michael DeGraffenreidt, who was taken by NYCFC in the third round of the 2017 MLS SuperDraft before a preseason knee injury derailed his first professional campaign. Based on head coach Gary Smith's comments, it seems like DeGraffenreidt's idea spot on the team would be as a pacey right fullback, with the possibility of filling in at centerback if need be.\n",
      "23-year-old Nigerian defensive midfielder Bolu Akinyode isn't the type of player to generate many stats, but he was an imposing physical presence in the middle of the pitch and an accurate passer of the ball from his holding position in 2017 for North Carolina FC. 26-year-old central midfielder Josh Huges will also be competing for a starting spot in the midfield; he played in an arena league last year but has previously worked with Gary Smith at Atlanta Silverbacks.\n",

Most Washington-area jurisdictions say they have not yet sent out property tax bills for the coming year which, according to the IRS, would mean property owners can not pay in advance and then claim a deduction before a new federal cap on deductions takes effect.\n",

      "SHANGHAI — It's Xi Jinping's economy now, and he isn't too worried about debt.\n",
      "China signaled its economic priorities on Wednesday at the end of a meeting of top Communist Party economic leaders with a statement indicating that President Xi is fully in charge. Labeled \"Xi Jinping Thought on Socialist Economy With Chinese Characteristics, \" the statement called for trimming industrial overcapacity, controlling the supply of money and other moves that have been staples of China's other recent declarations.\n",
      "Barely mentioned: China's surging debt. Despite downgrades this year by two international credit rating firms and warnings from institutions like the International Monetary Fund, the statement issued at the conclusion of the Central Economic Work Conference called for controlling borrowing by local governments, but it otherwise glossed over a vast borrowing splurge in recent years, driven in large part by Chinese companies.\n",
      "\"Prudent monetary policy should be kept neutral, the floodgates of monetary supply should be controlled, and credit and social financing should see reasonable growth, \" the statement said.\n",
      "The statement illustrates both Mr. Xi's growing clout and what economists say is a subtle shift in how China may address its debt pile — a shift that suggests leaders may be willing to tolerate even more debt if it will help growth.\n",
      "The label applied to the new statement echoes those used by past strong Chinese leaders like Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping and marks Mr. Xi's long ascent to become the Communist Party's unquestioned leader. Two months ago, the party lifted Mr. Xi to Mao's stature by enshrining \" Xi Jinping Thought. \"\n",

      "The state legislature might have more pressing issues, but when it convenes in February, legislators should pass a law making it clear to drivers that the left lane is for passing and turning left.\n",
      "\"Slower Traffic Keep Right\" signs already line hilly roads in Connecticut, but it's a good idea for drivers everywhere, whether on a steep hill or a flat interstate.\n",
      "Connecticut has an epidemic of left-lane lollygaggers, not only on its highways but on roads such as Route 44 west of Hartford and the Berlin Turnpike. Though many drivers complain about weavers who switch lanes to get around slower vehicles, the cause is often a car loitering in the left lane.\n",
      "Many states have laws restricting the left lanes of divided highways to vehicles that are passing traffic, and there's a good reason for it: The right-hand side of any vehicle has a larger blind spot. Passing a vehicle on the right is inherently more dangerous for all motorists.\n",
      "Connecticut law allows passing on the right only when there are three or more travel lanes, and Connecticut also forbids impeding traffic. But in more than 840,000 traffic stops from late 2013 to early 2015, not one single person was pulled over specifically for impeding traffic.\n",
      "Other states are more restrictive. Colorado, for example, prohibits traveling in the left lane of any highway where the speed limit is 65 or above. Illinois clearly states that \"a vehicle may not be driven in the left lane, except when overtaking and passing another vehicle.\"\n",

The digital clock in the Kim Il Sung Stadium in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, has stopped counting — a large \"90\" frozen on the scoreboard. The match, a 2019 Asian Cup qualifier against Lebanon on Sept. 5, was a rare chance for the large North Korean crowd to see their men's team play. The Chollima, as the national team is known — named after a mythical winged horse that flies at supersonic speeds and can never be mounted by mortal man — had not played a home game in Pyongyang for almost two years. The last, a 2-0 victory against Bahrain in a 2018 World Cup qualification in November 2015, was meant to be followed by more World Cup games. After all, North Korea has a pedigree when it comes to the World Cup and was considered one of Asia's stronger teams. But the facts on the ground had changed.\n",

The Chollima were leading 2-1 with six minutes to go and guaranteed a spot in the final round. But they conceded twice late, meaning that the World Cup was finished for them. Andersen, a former Norway international striker who in 1990 became the first foreigner to be the top scorer of Germany's Bundesliga, became only the second foreign coach in North Korea's history. He was charged with getting North Korea to the 2019 AFC Asian Cup finals. That hadn't quite gone to plan either. One of their Group B rivals, alongside Lebanon and Hong Kong, was Malaysia. Both games had been postponed following a diplomatic fallout when the half brother of North Korea's young leader, Kim Jong Un, was assassinated in a bizarre plot using nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur Airport.

Those days now seem far behind for America's for-profit prison giants, which heartily backed Trump during the campaign, gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to his inaugural committee after the election, and are now set to benefit from his newly passed tax plan. \"I do think we can do a lot of privatizations and private prisons, \" Trump said in 2016. \"It seems to work a lot better.\"\n"

Fueled by the administration's deportation dragnet, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has predicted a surge in its daily population of detainees, from around 34,000 in July to more than 51,000 over the next year — and prison companies are more than happy to accommodate. In April, GEO Group executives won the administration's first private immigration detention contract, for a facility in Conroe, Texas, that's expected to bring in $44 million annually. This year the company also started operating an ICE detention center in Folkston, Georgia, that could boost i\n",

      "Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain) has had her share of bad luck. A freak accident on the slopes ended her skiing career, and it took no small amount of self-confidence and hustle to get her life back in balance — as proprietor of a high-stakes poker game.\n",
      "Regular Joes need not apply — Molly's game is strictly for high rollers who can afford to lose thousands of dollars at the gambling table. Among them is Player X (Michael Cera), a movie star who excels at poker but who exudes moral bankruptcy. He also has an itch for Molly, which becomes a factor in her decision to move her operation from Los Angeles to New York.\n",
      "At first, things go great for her in the Big Apple. But Molly's phenomenal success in attracting Wall Street bigwigs leads to sloppiness, and it's not long before she's nabbed by federal agents for crossing the line into criminality. Threatened with prison unless she cooperates, Molly declines. She may be a lawbreaker, but she's no snitch.\n",
      "That's where Charlie Jaffey (Idris Elba) comes in. A lawyer of unimpeachable credentials, Jaffey is skeptical that Molly is as clean as she claims to be. But he also believes she deserves her freedom.\n",
      "\"Molly's Game\" is the stylish and absorbing directorial debut of Oscar-winning screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (\"The Social Network, \" \"The West Wing\"). Working from a script that he adapted from Bloom's memoir, Sorkin crafts a fast-moving tale of risky business, crammed with the kind of snappy dialogue for which he's famous.\n",
      "But the film wouldn't work quite as well without Chastain, who turns in an Oscar-worthy performance as a determined woman who always has another angle to explore. She gets deep inside Molly's skin, exposing her insecurities while showcasing her strengths. And her scenes opposite a never-better Elba, who is still best known for his work on HBO's \"The Wire, \" sizzle with electricity.\n",

      "China's new statement on economic priorities illustrates President Xi Jinping's growing clout, as well as a subtle shift in how the country may address its debt pile.CreditFred Dufour/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images\n",
      "SHANGHAI — It's Xi Jinping's economy now, and he isn't too worried about debt.\n",
      "China signaled its economic priorities on Wednesday at the end of a meeting of top Communist Party economic leaders with a statement indicating that President Xi is fully in charge. Labeled \"Xi Jinping Thought on Socialist Economy With Chinese Characteristics, \" the statement called for trimming industrial overcapacity, controlling the supply of money and other moves that have been staples of China's other recent declarations.\n",
      "Barely mentioned: China's surging debt. Despite downgrades this year by two international credit rating firms and warnings from institutions like the International Monetary Fund, the statement issued at the conclusion of the Central Economic Work Conference called for controlling borrowing by local governments, but it otherwise glossed over a vast borrowing splurge in recent years, driven in large part by Chinese companies.\n",
      "\"Prudent monetary policy should be kept neutral, the floodgates of monetary supply should be controlled, and credit and social financing should see reasonable growth, \" the statement said.\n",
      "The statement illustrates both Mr. Xi's growing clout and what economists say is a subtle shift in how China may address its debt pile — a shift that suggests leaders may be willing to tolerate even more debt if it will help growth.\n",
      "The label applied to the new statement echoes those used by past strong Chinese leaders like Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping and marks Mr. Xi's long ascent to become the Communist Party's unquestioned leader. Two months ago, the party lifted Mr. Xi to Mao's stature by enshrining \" Xi Jinping Thought. \"\n",

      "The state legislature might have more pressing issues, but when it convenes in February, legislators should pass a law making it clear to drivers that the left lane is for passing and turning left.\n",
      "\"Slower Traffic Keep Right\" signs already line hilly roads in Connecticut, but it's a good idea for drivers everywhere, whether on a steep hill or a flat interstate.\n",
      "Connecticut has an epidemic of left-lane lollygaggers, not only on its highways but on roads such as Route 44 west of Hartford and the Berlin Turnpike. Though many drivers complain about weavers who switch lanes to get around slower vehicles, the cause is often a car loitering in the left lane.\n",
      "Many states have laws restricting the left lanes of divided highways to vehicles that are passing traffic, and there's a good reason for it: The right-hand side of any vehicle has a larger blind spot. Passing a vehicle on the right is inherently more dangerous for all motorists.\n",
      "Connecticut law allows passing on the right only when there are three or more travel lanes, and Connecticut also forbids impeding traffic. But in more than 840,000 traffic stops from late 2013 to early 2015, not one single person was pulled over specifically for impeding traffic.\n",
      "Other states are more restrictive. Colorado, for example, prohibits traveling in the left lane of any highway where the speed limit is 65 or above. Illinois clearly states that \"a vehicle may not be driven in the left lane, except when overtaking and passing another vehicle.\"\n",
      "Legislators should pass a law that encourages drivers to keep right unless passing on all of Connecticut's roads. It's a universal \"rule of the road, \" but it needs to be spelled out, and enforcement needs to be stepped up.\n",

      "Back in August, after losing 5-1 on aggregate to Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup, Ernesto Valverde, having just finished his first preseason as Barcelona's new manager, sat in the press room and reflected on his team's poor performance.\n",
      "\"They [Real Madrid] had a sense of energy, pressed more intensely and punished on our mistakes, \" he said speaking in the post-match conference.\n",
      "But as the conference went on, Valverde highlighted another reason for the loss. \"Things have happened this preseason that can affect the team's imbalance. So we have to find a new balance, play well, all-around and find results.\"\n",
      "For a quiet, reserved, disciplined man such as Valverde, one can only imagine how difficult this past summer must have been. Neymar's transfer saga, Pique's famous response to the transfer, the actual transfer and Paulinho's somewhat controversial arrival — they all contributed to that imbalance.\n",
      "Four months later, though, and the Catalan giants sit undefeated and on top of La Liga with an imposing +35 goal differential, six points above second-place Atletico and 11 points clear of Real Madrid, which has a game in hand.\n",
      "This is the third-biggest point disparity in head-to-head meetings between these teams (16 points in 2012-2013, 13 points in 1990-1991), which is why it's almost impossible to oversell the importance of Saturday's El Clasico.\n",
      "A victory for Barcelona, and the leader would pad its lead after playing arguably its most difficult game of the season. In the context of La Liga and what it means for Barcelona's title hopes, it's enormous.\n",
      "It has been a strong first half of the season for Valverde's squad and much of the club's success, naturally, is thanks to the prodigious talent of Lionel Messi, who has directly contributed to 19 goals so far this season. His 14 goals and five assists have been a pivotal factor on why Barca has delivered good results.\n",

      "\"I told him I didn't want to play any more. He was phoning and phoning but I said: 'I'm not going to play.'\" The calls came, the president on the line, but Jose Paulo Bezerra Maciel Junior — better known as Paulinho, hardly known at all then — had made up his mind. He had headed home to Sao Paulo, yet rather than returning to his boyhood club he was giving up on the game. He had had enough, aged 19. \"In Lithuania they had racially abused me, in Poland they hadn't paid me, and I thought: 'I don't need this,'\" he says. \"I said to my family: 'I'm not playing football again.'\"\n",
      "Which was when his then-wife intervened, telling him to think about his parents — a council worker and a supermarket manager who had supported him since he started playing at the age of five. Ditching it all would, she said, show a lack of respect to them. Paulinho and his wife had just had a baby daughter too and, besides, she asked: 'What else can you do?' It is a good question. What would he have done? Paulinho smiles. \"I really don't know, \" he says. \"She said: 'The only thing you know how to do is play football.'\" And so that is what he did.\n",

He tells his story steadily, dating every decision. \"It's been a rollercoaster, \" he says. He has played in six countries in three continents, been a Copa Libertadores champion and relegated too, suffered the greatest humiliation in Brazil's history and been abused, unpaid, written off.

      "Binnquist spent 13 years working for San Marino, working in the planning and building division and finance department. She was hired by Alhambra in 2009 as the assistant to the city manager.\n",
      "\"I have loved my time serving the citizens of Alhambra, \" Binnquist said in a statement. \"I look forward to working alongside the Council, staff and the community to ensure Alhambrans continue to enjoy an enhanced quality of life.\"\n",
      "The City Council is set to vote on Binnquist's contract at its Jan. 8 meeting. The terms of the contract were not immediately available Tuesday evening.\n",

      "The artwork of West Seattle's Kyler Martz adorns each of Amazon's 30 Treasure Trucks. He was making a living as a tattoo artist when Amazon came calling, looking for help to define the circus-caravan style of the roving vans offering one-day deals.\n",
      "The first sign that you're entering Kyler Martz's time machine is the bright-red 1965 Datsun 320 — immaculately polished, farcically small compared with modern pickups — that sits in his West Seattle driveway.\n",

      "A brown leather couch sits against a back wall, flanked by antique file cabinets, and a library-style card catalog. Above is Martz's art — prints, wood pieces and sculpture with a funky, sometimes nautical, retro style. At the front of the studio is an expansive wooden desk, and, underneath it, the rare sign of modernity: a printer.\n",
      "Martz, the desk and the printer spent much of the last year in the service of an unlikely customer: Amazon.com.\n",
      "Martz's artwork adorns each of the 30 vehicles in Amazon's fleet of Treasure Trucks, the roving vans that dispense one-day deals in cities across the country. Each is customized with Martz's animal characters, which appear alongside the city's name on the bottom of the customer-facing side, and a circular badge on the other.\n",

      "The Treasure Truck is among the most unusual of Amazon's experiments testing new or different ways to sell things to people.\n",
