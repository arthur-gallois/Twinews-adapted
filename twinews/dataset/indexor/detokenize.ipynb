      "HUNTINGTON (WOWK TV) printing is the future and it right here in our area. The Robert C Byrd Institute in Huntington is leading the way in innovation. Jamie Cope is the Deputy Director and he says there so much more to 3D printing than just a finished object. Cope says prototypes for new inventions, body part replicas before surgeries, and high - end industry parts like rocket nozzles are just the beginning. While the organization is located in Huntington, their reach is all over the United States. \"printing allows technologies to get into people hands and develop rapid prototyping and tooling, which is advancing the industry and creating jobs, Cope said. And little did most people know, RCBI is open to the public. If you know nothing about 3D printing technology that okay, too. Cope says there is a team of people ready to educate you, give you access to their equipment, and show you how to use it. Cope says he has seen ideas turn into inventions many times. We give people inspiration and hope through what they able to see had been done. So, something like this that a model that was made by an MRI, they can see, Wow, if they can do that then what else could be done, Cope said. \"And their wheels start turning and they get ideas and the next thing you know they off creating. You can find out more about RCBI and 3D printing technology by clicking here. There are also RCBI locations in Bridgeport and Charleston. The Huntington location specializes in 3D printing.\n",

      "(WLFI) Not many people truly understand internet neutrality. Scroll for more content... It a complex issue that I think has unfortunately been demagogued to a certain degree, said State Sen. Brandt Hershman. Both sides of the net neutrality argument feel that way. \"If people have heard about it, some of it depends on who they heard about it from, said Purdue Computer Science Professor Gene Spafford. Net Neutrality rules were put into place in __int_4__ to ensure internet service providers treat all online content equally to prevent them from favoring their own digital services over rivals. Now, the FCC plans to repeal the rules. Hershman supports the idea. \"If one company tries to squeeze your ability to access content, you likely to drop them and go someplace else, said Hershman. \"And I think that kind of effective competition in which the consumer has choices is far better in the marketplace than government regulation. But Spafford said when it comes to internet service providers, we do have many choices, and the ones we do have, we ca trust. \"These are not organizations that are acting on the public behalf, they acting to make a profit, said Spafford. \"And they going to adopt whatever mechanisms allow them to do that. \"I think that is extremely unlikely, said Hershman. \"When we deregulated telecommunications in Indiana there was an assertion that there would be some favoritism like this that would occur and it did and it has and the reason is because there is vibrant competition in the marketplace. Spafford thinks that like comparing apples to oranges. \"For the telephone, it not a case where if I pick up the receiver I have to endure a commercial. Or if I dial some numbers to talk to somebody I get a message that says you have to subscribe to our ultra service for another __int_2__ dollars a month, said Spafford. That the kind of situation Spafford thinks consumers of the internet will be in without neutrality rules. But Hershman said hypotheticals are just scare tactics. \"Because at the end of the day, these businesses want to serve consumers in a way that the consumers buy their product, said Hershman. But Spafford said he knows how large companies work. \"It wo be all at once, it wo be all of a sudden, it will be in little bits and pieces so that the public wo be as aware of what going on, said Spafford. The FCC will vote on the decision next month.\n",

      "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. Since __int_4__ a lot of time and money has been spent in communities across Tampa Bay installing pedestrian - activated flashing crosswalks to improve safety. But those flashing signals, and any plans to continue to install them, might soon fade away. EARLIER: Could 3D crosswalks be potential solution to a deadly problem? The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) issued a letter of termination in late December which turned back its previous approval of the signals, known as rectangular rapid flashing beacons, or RRFBs. The signals were approved on an interim basis in __int_4__ But it was recently discovered the technology has since been patented. \"It unbelievable, said Whit Blanton, director of Forward Pinellas, the county metropolitan planning organization. \"I was really stunned they would reverse what a proven safety measure. Federal regulations prohibit the use of patented devices, according to the FHWA. \"It is against the public interest to encourage the exclusive use of proprietary products, FHWA spokesperson Neil Gaffney said in an email. So what does that mean for the hundreds of such crosswalks across the Bay area and the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent to install them? More than __int_3__ RRFBs have been installed in St. Petersburg since __int_4__ according to Mike Frederick, the city neighborhood transportation manager. The city had plans to install an additional __int_2__ but it unclear now if that will happen. Tampa officials are planning to install more than __int_2__ RRFBs, in addition to the nearly two dozen already in use. While further installation work must stop, Jean Duncan, who oversees Tampa transportation and stormwater services department, said she believes it only temporary. \"We hopeful the Federal Highway Administration can get this worked out, Duncan said. \"It too soon for us to retreat and do something else. The good news is that existing installations with proper approvals may remain in place until replacements are necessary, according to FHWA. While the RRFBs are not cheap roughly a piece Blanton says they are proven to be working. In terms of their effectiveness, they are through the roof, he said. \"We seen rates from __int_2__ percent compliance in motorists yielding or stopping for pedestrians entering the crosswalk. Before the flashing crosswalks, less than five percent of motorists bothered to stop for pedestrians at a crosswalk, according to Blanton. As for the patents in question, Rick Jones, CEO of Venice - based Stop Experts, holds two, which are featured on his company website. Jones declined to comment, only saying the situation is \"extremely political. Blanton worries drivers and pedestrians will be left extremely confused by the sudden need for a change. He looking at alternatives, like flashing lights installed in the road, but hopes the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) will provide guidance. \"You drive up and down Gulf Blvd. in St. Petersburg, you on Bayshore in Safety Harbor, you see them and you used to them, but any time you introduce inconsistencies into the process then we have a worry from a safety standpoint, he said. F DOT issued the following statement in response to questions from 10News FDOT is currently collecting data and reviewing the termination of MUTCD Interim Approval __int_2__ in coordination with FHWA. We will provide guidance for RRFB installations on State Roads. Installations on local roads should be addressed by the County or City with local jurisdiction for the associated road.

      "In __int_4__ I finally managed to find love and peace in the world of physical fitness. Every year, I felt ashamed for not being able to achieve my goal of looking like the Victoria Secret models I see on TV and online. In __int_4__ I said no to the treadmill and the gym membership. Instead, I decided to do what I have always wanted to do but never had the courage to try: pole dancing. Despite the scandalous quality people associate with pole dancing, or perhaps because of it, I fell in love with this sport the moment I walked into my first class. Each class started with a warm - up consisting of hip rolls, body waves, bridge grinds, hip circles, sexy push - ups, regular push - ups, and much more. Each class ended with the girls taking turn free - styling to the music of their choice. As I watched all of the beautiful women expressing their emotion and sexuality through their movements, I started to see beauty where I could see before. Every single woman in class, regardless of how tall or short, curvy or thin, young or old, looked stunning as they fearlessly owned the dance floor. With each milestone I achieved, be it climbing my way up the approximately __int_2__ ft pole or mastering a new trick, I became more and more confident as well. As the confident woman within gradually pushed aside the insecure girl, I was able to slowly fall in love with every inch of my body perfect imperfection. What pole dancing ultimately gave me, what running and the gym did not, was confidence. This journey enabled me to realize that the mentality I used to have regarding exercise was not only wrong, but unhealthy. It was the \"ideal\" body that I sought after. It was confidence and happiness. I was pursuing a glorified goal as a filler for the self - confidence and happiness I lacked. I thought that if I were to look like those models I would be happy. The goal of that subjective \"ideal\" body was never strong enough to keep me exercising on a regular basis because as time passed, I lost willpower more and more easily. When I found a source of confidence however, I no longer viewed the act of physical exercise as a chore. I was no longer forcing myself to do things I did enjoy. Pole dancing also offered me a medium for self - expression. As I was getting over a painful breakup around, I danced my heart out to the Pussycat Doll \"Happily Never After\" for days. Whenever I need a boost of confidence, I would put on some music and I let my sensual self take over to the beats of Ariana Grande or Britney Spears. Pole dancing, and therefore exercising, is now a part of my identity. Telling me to stop pole dancing is the same as telling me to cut out a piece of what makes me me. I know a lot of people have said that you supposed to do the things that you do want to and keep doing it until it becomes a routine. There is indeed a lot of value in that frame of mind. However, this outlook might not work for everyone when it comes to exercise. It certainly did work for me. It just made me feel worse when I could keep it up. Therefore, do buy that gym membership if you will stop going there after a few months, if you hate the treadmill or elliptical. Go out and find the exercises that make you feel good. So what if it exploring an alter ego under the dim lights of a pole dancing studio? So what if it going to salsa lessons once a week? So what if it doing something completely different each time? There is no correct way to live, just as there is no correct way to exercise. For me, it was when I found a love in pole dancing that exercise no longer became something I had to do for some New Year resolution. It was when I finally found something capable of giving me true confidence that I became fitter than I ever been.\n"

Nevertheless, the wingnut feversphere has been screaming for years that HILLARY CLINTON GAVE __int_2__ OF AMERICA URANIUM TO VLADIMIR! Which makes no goddamn sense, unless you remember that it came from Steve Bannon. Fuckin 'Bannon? I KNEW IT! See, one of Uranium One prior owners had contributed __int_3__ million to the Clinton Foundation. He sold his stake in the company long before it was sold to Rosatom, never discussed it with Clinton, and made no money off the sale. But those are facts, so PFFFT. Per Mother Jones, In __int_4__ Bannon and Peter Schweizer, a conservative author most notably of that POS Clinton Cash book, established a tax - exempt nonprofit organization called the Government Accountability Institute. They used funding from the family foundation of hedge funder manager and conservative mega - donor Robert Mercer. ... Schweizer biggest achievement was to get some of his claims into the the New York Times. The Times, eager to show it was serious about investigating Hillary Clinton, entered what it called an \"exclusive\" agreement to base a reporting project on Schweizer work. The result was an April __int_2__ article headlined: Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal. Excellent journalism, NYT! Trump Tweets, Republicans Obey So Donald Trump campaign cut a million attack ads falsely accusing Clinton of taking bribes to give America uranium to the Russians, and Fox viewers were treated to one million on - air Hannity - gasms. But the Justice Department failed to prosecute Hillary because BIASSS. Or because there was literally nothing there, which is why Jeff Sessions did LOCK HER UP either. Uranium deal to Russia, with Clinton help and Obama Administration knowledge, is the biggest story that Fake Media does want to follow! Donald Trump (October __int_2__ Whoever in DOJ is capable w authority to appoint a special counsel shld do so to investigate Uranium One \"whoever\" means if u are recused ChuckGrassley (October __int_2__ It always comes back to Gowdy! In October of __int_4__ Ron DeSantis (R - Florida Man) and Devin Nunes started showing up on Fox to say they had a hot new witness who was going to blow the lid off this whole Uranium One thing. Hillary was finally going down! Hannity drycleaning bill for October was CRAZY! Republican Members of the House Intelligence Committee (HIPSCI) were interviewing their star witness and getting all the sexxxy dirts on Hillary. But oddly enough, they would let HIPSCI Democrats near their guy. Elijah Cummings and Adam Schiff sent multiple letters requesting access, but old Trey Gowdy just ignored them. Yes, we know that Devin Nunes is \"Chair\" of the House Intelligence Committee. But in case you did notice, he dumber than string cheese. Which may be why Cummings wrote to Gowdy on November __int_1__ and again on November __int_2__ to protest the lack of access. This is not a responsible way to conduct an investigation. I do not know why you are hiding this former informant, despite the fact that the FBI has authorized the individual to speak to both Republicans and Democrats. However, your refusal to allow Members of our Committee to speak with this individual and to evaluate this individual claims raises serious questions about the credibility of the Committee investigation. Yes, yes it does. Was Gowdy just being a dick like usual? Or was there more to it? Are you new here? There always a scheme with these slippery sonsabitches! Seems their star witness, William Campbell, was a little credibility - challenged. Campbell had been working at a Rosatom subsidiary when he got caught up in a __int_4__ kickback investigation. At first investigators thought Campbell was a victim. After interviewing him at length, however, they decided he was likely a participant in the crime and could not be used as a witness in the investigation. At no point during his FBI interviews did Campbell mention Clinton or bribes. But in __int_4__ he had a change of heart and memory and started claiming to have proof that Clinton had cooked up the Uranium One Deal on her Behghazi email server (probably) So weird that Gowdy did want Democrats to have access to this guy, who is BASICALLY the same as the dude with the story about the yellowcake in Niger! (That was a deep cut for you olds, you are welcome. DO NOT mess with Elijah Cummings! Which brings us to yesterday, when Elijah Cummings and Adam Schiff published their letter to Trey Gowdy and Devin Nunes outlining all of the above. Congressmen Cummings and Schiff also detailed a December __int_4__ briefing of the HIPSCI members where Jeff Sessions Department of Justice trashed Campbell and cleared Hillary Clinton of wrongdoing, admitting their investigation turned up \"no allegations of impropriety or illegality\" by Hillary Clinton. Let repeat: Jeff Sessions DOJ found NO IMPROPRIETY OR ILLEGALITY BY HILLARY CLINTON. So, to summarize, Gowdy, Nunes, and the rest of the Republican members of HIPSCI have been playing hide the salami lying witness, because they knew he blow their HILLARY URANIUM bullshit right out of the water. They continued to go on Fox and peddle what they knew were lies, despite having been told by the Sessions Justice Department that THERE IS NO HILLARY URANIUM STORY. So, now what? Well, now the Republicans have finally agreed to let Democrats interview their \"confidential informant. BUT, they not going to allow the interview to be transcribed, so there will be no written record of whatever nonsense he spews. Neat trick, huh? YEAH. Well that explains Trey Gowdy Road to Damascus conversion. The guy was a prosecutor he knows he knee deep in wildly unethical shit. @TGowdySC on Mueller probe: There may or may not be crimes, domestic crimes associated with that, but it a foreign power trying to interfere with the gears of our democracy. The hack of the DNC server is a crime. The accessing of John Podesta email is a crime. TheStory Fox News (February __int_1__ He better damn well hope Republicans keep control of the House, because Democrats are going to run the Mother of All House Ethics Investigations when they next in charge. They already getting testy and posting Trey and Devin nasty little secrets on Medium when Republicans abuse the classification process to hide the fact that they carrying water for the president. No wonder Gowdy calling himself a \"lousy politician\" on the way to hightailing it out of the House of Representatives. Can confirm, NOT FAKE NEWS. Follow your FDF on Twitter! Please money us so we can buy more life - sustaining uranium! Also, pay for the Wonkserver! Mother Jones Reuters Cummings Schiff Letter Medium\n"

      "WASHINGTON (AP) One month before the Trump administration sparked outrage by reversing a ban on trophies from threatened African elephants, federal officials quietly loosened restrictions on the importation of heads and hides of lions shot for sport. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began issuing permits Oct. __int_2__ for lions killed in Zimbabwe and Zambia between __int_4__ and __int_4__ The agency is also currently studying whether to add three additional countries to the list Mozambique, Namibia and Tanzania. Previously, only wild lions killed in South Africa were eligible to be imported. In a pair of recent tweets, President Donald Trump said he will delay the new policy on allowing elephant trophies, but he made no mention of lions. Trump, whose adult sons are avid big - game hunters, also expressed skepticism about his own administration claim that killing threatened animals could help save them by helping raise money for conservation programs. \"Big - game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal, the president tweeted on Sunday. Trump weighed in after a strong public backlash against reversing an Obama - era ban on elephant trophies, which became public through a written notification posted in the Federal Register. Officials said there was no such legal requirement for notifying the public about the policy change on lions. In late __int_4__ the Obama administration added two subspecies of African lion to the list of animals protected under the Endangered Species Act. Due to poaching and habitat loss, the number of lions living in the wild is in sharp decline from an estimated a century ago to less than today. The additional protections were added a few months after Minnesota dentist Walter Palmer sparked international outcry by killing Cecil, a beloved - old lion who lived in Zimbabwe Hwange National Park. Palmer paid to bow - hunt Cecil on private land just outside the park. A photo of Donald Trump Jr. holding a knife and the bloody severed tail of an elephant he reportedly killed in Zimbabwe in __int_4__ has also drawn ire from animal rights activists. Wayne Pacelle, the president and CEO of The Humane Society of the United States, said he is encouraged that the president is taking a second look at the issue. \"Keeping elephants and lions alive is a key to economic progress in so many African nations, Pacelle said. \"Trophy hunting robs these nations of their greatest resources, diminishing the wildlife - watching experiences of so many tourists. Any U.S. sanctioning of trophy hunting sends a particularly contradictory message at a time when the world has been rallying to save elephants and lions.\n",

      "Watching the alpha geeks, sharing their stories, helping the future unfold. A prototype of the de Havilland Comet. An object lesson for today. Source: Wikipedia Media in the Age of Algorithms Since Tuesday election, there been a lot of finger pointing, and many of those fingers are pointing at Facebook, arguing that their newsfeed algorithms played a major role in spreading misinformation and magnifying polarization. Some of the articles are thoughtful in their criticism, others thoughtful in their defense of Facebook, while others are full of the very misinformation and polarization that they hope will get them to the top of everyone newsfeed. But all of them seem to me to make a fundamental error in how they are thinking about media in the age of algorithms. Consider Jessica Lessin argument in The Information: I am deeply, deeply worried about the calls I am hearing, from journalists and friends, for Facebook to intervene and accept responsibility for ensuring citizens are well - informed and getting a balanced perspective... Facebook promoting trustworthiness sounds great. Who is in favor of accepting responsibility and ferreting out misinformation? But major moves on Facebook part to mediate good information from bad information would put the company in the impossible position of having to determine \"truth, which seems far more objective than it really is. Moreover, it would be bad for society. My response: Facebook crossed this river long ago. Once they got into the business of curating the newsfeed rather than simply treating it as a timeline, they put themselves in the position of mediating what people are going to see. They became a gatekeeper and a guide. This is not an impossible position. It their job. So they better make a priority of being good at it. But those who argue strongly for Facebook responsibility to weed out the good from the bad also get it wrong. For example, on Vox, Timothy Lee wrote: A big issue here is about the way Facebook has staffed its editorial efforts. In a traditional news organization, experienced editorial staff occupy senior roles. In contrast, Facebook has relegated the few editorial decisions it has made to junior staffers. For example, until earlier this year Facebook had a team of __int_2__ to __int_2__ independent contractors who were in charge of writing headlines for Facebook \"trending news\" box. When Facebook faced accusations that these staffers were suppressing conservative stories, Facebook panicked and laid all of them off, running the trending stories box as an automated feature instead. But that has worked so well either, as fake news keeps popping up in the trending news box. The problem here was that Facebook was employing human editors to evaluate stories and write headlines. The problem was that Facebook leadership did treat this as an important part of Facebook operations. If Facebook had an experienced, senior editorial team in place, there a lot it could do to steer users toward high - quality, deeply reported news stories and away from superficial, sensationalistic, or outright inaccurate ones. Lee is right to say that curating the news feed is a job for junior staffers and independent contractors. But he wrong that it a job for \"an experienced, senior editorial team. It a job for the brightest minds on Facebook algorithm team! And Lee is wrong to say that the problem was that Facebook was employing human editors to evaluate stories and write headlines. That was precisely the problem. Like drivers following a GPS over a bridge that no longer exists, both Jessica Lessin and Timothy Lee are operating from a out - of - date map of the world. In that old map, algorithms are overseen by humans who intervene in specific cases to compensate for their mistakes. As Jessica rightly notes, this is a very slippery slope. ... We should let Facebook off the hook for every problem it creates or exacerbates. But we ca hold it responsible for each of them either. We witnessing the effects of a world where the internet has driven the cost of saying whatever you want to whomever you want to zero, as Sam often says. This is an irreversible trend no company can stop, nor should we want them to. But there is a good existence proof for another approach, one that Facebook has worked long and hard to emulate. Google has long demonstrated that you can help guide people to better results without preventing anyone free speech. Like Facebook, they are faced every day with determining which of a thousand competing voices deserve to be at the top of the list. The original insight that Google was founded on, that a link is a vote, and that links from reputable sources that had been around a long time, were worth more than others, was their initial tool for weeding out the wheat from the chaff. But over the years, they developed hundreds if not thousands of signals that help to determine which links are the most valuable. For the better part of two decades, Google has worked tirelessly to thread the needle between curating an algorithmic feed of a firehose of content that can be created by anyone and simply picking winners and losers. And here the key point: they do this without actually making judgments about the actual content of the page. The \"truth signal\" is in the metadata, not the data. Anyone who wants to understand how a 21st century company tackles the problem of editorial curation in a world of infinite information and limited attention would do well to study the history and best practices of Google search quality team, which are well documented and widely shared. Here one video from Matt Cutts, former head of the Google web spam team. What Google teaches us is that improving the algorithms to deliver better results is a constant battle, because there are always those who are trying to game the system. But they also teach us that the right answer is not to make manual interventions to remove specific results. Google and Facebook constantly devise and test new algorithms. Yes, there is human judgment involved. But it judgment applied to the design of a system, not to a specific result. Designing an effective algorithm for search or the newsfeed has more in common with designing an airplane so it flies, or designing a new airplane so that it can fly faster than the old one, than with deciding where that airplane flies. Improving the \"truth value\" of articles does depend on manual interventions to weed out bad results, as commentators on both sides of this issue seem to think, but on discovering signals that cause good results to float to the top. The question is how to determine what \"good results\" means. In the case of making an airplane fly, the goals are simple stay aloft, go faster, use less fuel and design changes can be rigorously tested against the desired outcome. There are many analogous problems in search finding the best price, or the most authoritative source of information on a topic, or a particular document and many that are far less rigorous. And when users get right to what they want, the users are happy, and so, generally, are advertisers. Unfortunately, unlike search, where the desires of the users to find an answer and get on with their lives are generally aligned with \"give them the best results\" Facebook prioritization of \"engagement\" may be leading them in the wrong direction. What is best for Facebook revenue may not be best for users. Even in the case of physical systems like aerodynamics and flight engineering, there are often hidden assumptions to be tested and corrected. In one famous example that determined the future of the aerospace industry, a radically new understanding of how to deal with metal fatigue was needed. As described by University of Texas professor Michael Marder: Britain was set to dominate the jet age. In __int_4__ the de Havillands Comet began commercial service, triumphantly connecting London with the farthest reaches of the Empire. The jet plane was years ahead of any competitor, gorgeous to look at, and set new standards for comfort and quiet in the air. Then things went horribly wrong. In __int_4__ a Comet fell out of the sky, and the crash was attributed to bad weather and pilot error... In __int_4__ a second Comet fell out of clear skies near Rome. The fleet was grounded for two months while repairs were made. Flights then resumed with the declaration, Although no definite reason for the accident has been established, modifications are being embodied to cover every possibility that imagination has suggested as a likely cause of the disaster. When these modifications are completed and have been satisfactorily flight tested, the Board sees no reason why passenger services should not be resumed. Four days after these words were written a third Comet fell into the sea out of clear skies near Naples and the fleet was grounded again indefinitely. ... As the Comet accident report was being released in __int_4__ a little - known military contractor in the northwest corner of the United States was completing its prototype for a civilian jet airplane. Boeing had had little success with civilian craft in the past. The company knew that cracks had brought down the Comet, and they had better understand them before they brought down the Boeing __int_3__ Boeing brought in a researcher for the summer, Paul Paris, a mechanical engineer who had just finished a Master degree and was pursuing graduate studies at Lehigh University... The view of fracture Paris brought to Boeing was dramatically different from the one that had guided construction of the Comet. Cracks were the centerpiece of the investigation. They could not be eliminated. They were everywhere, permeating the structure, too small to be seen. The structure could not be made perfect, it was inherently flawed, and the goal of engineering design was not to certify the airframe free of cracks but to make it tolerate them. Emphasis mine. The essence of algorithm design is not to eliminate all error, but to make results robust in the face of error. Where de Havillands tried in vain to engineer a plane where the materials were strong enough to resist all cracks and fatigue, Boeing realized that the right approach was to engineer a design that allowed cracks, but kept them from propagating so far that they led to catastrophic failure. That is also Facebook challenge. Facebook comment in response to Timothy Lee suggests that they understand the challenge they face. We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation. In News Feed we use various signals based on community feedback to determine which posts are likely to contain inaccurate information, and reduce their distribution. In Trending we look at a variety of signals to help make sure the topics being shown are reflective of real - world events, and take additional steps to prevent false or misleading content from appearing. Despite these efforts we understand there so much more we need to do, and that is why it important that we keep improving our ability to detect misinformation. We committed to continuing to work on this issue and improve the experiences on our platform. The key question to ask is not whether Facebook should be curating the news feed, but HOW. They clearly have a lot of work to do. I believe they are taking the problem very seriously. I hope they make breakthroughs that do force them to choose between their business model and giving better results to their users. If they do, I fear that despite their good intentions, the business model will win. Their goal is to find a way for the plane to fly faster, but fly safely. The bright side: searching through the possibility space for the intersection of truth AND engagement could lead Facebook to some remarkable discoveries. Pushing for what is hard makes you better. But the answer is not for Facebook to put journalists to work weeding out the good from the bad. It is to understand, in the same way that they so successfully divined the features that lead to higher engagement, how to build algorithms that take into account \"truth\" as well as popularity. And they need to be asking themselves whether they are de Havilland or Boeing. I sent a copy of this article to Matt Cutts, former head of the web spam team at Google. I thought his experience with Google __int_4__ Panda search algorithm update, which they introduced in response to the rise of low quality \"content farms, was very relevant to today discussion. Much as there are today about Facebook, there were articles about Google failing. (I was quoted in one of them, saying that Google was \"losing some kind of war with spammers. Like Facebook today, Google was already wrestling with these concerns, but the public feedback still played an important role in Google taking the problem seriously, despite the financial consequences to the company. Matt wrote back: For Google, the growth of content farms and low - quality sites threatened users' trust in Google search result. When external commentary started to mirror our own internal discussions and concerns, that was a real wake up call. The Panda algorithm was Google response, and it sought to reward higher - quality sites and to encourage a healthier web ecosystem. In my personal opinion, I see a pretty direct analogy between the Panda algorithm and what Facebook is going through now. It seems like Facebook touchstones have been connecting people and engagement. But you get what you measure, and the dark side of engagement might produce shady stories, hoaxes, incorrect information, or polarizing memes as an unintended consequence. With Panda, Google took a big enough revenue hit via some partners that Google actually needed to disclose Panda as a material impact on an earnings call. But I believe it was the right decision to launch Panda, both for the long - term trust of our users and for a better ecosystem for publishers. Facebook is a different company, but I be interested to see how they tackle some of these recent issues. As noted above, the problem of fake news and bad sites trying to game the system is a constant battle. Google too is struggling with a wave of fake news sites right now. See for example the false Google news result shown in this tweet from Aza Raskin. (Thanks, Jim Stogdill, for pointing it out. Isaiah Saxon has also sent me a couple of examples. This is an industry wide problem, not just a problem for Facebook, and companies should share data and best practices in the effort to combat it. Second Addendum (ongoing) I thought it might be worthwhile to collect useful links I come across that relate to algorithmic analysis of content about the election, some of which might be useful to people wrestling with this problem. Feel free to suggest more in the comments. This first one is just a great read as a way of introducing the algorithmic data science mindset if you not already familiar with it.\n"

      "Quin Hillyer: Roy Moore own words prove his falsehood Even if we do know for certain whether Roy Moore had sexual contact (of a sort) with - old Leigh Corfman, we now know that Moore has made a conscious decision to lie about his onetime relationships with teenage girls. We know this from a combination of his own words and of new evidence that would be accepted as probative in any American court of law. (More on the evidence, shortly. The odd thing is that Moore initial reaction was to tell at least a simulacrum of the truth, only later to change to a flat - out lie. Often, a liar works in the other direction, at first denying everything and then admitting little dribs and drabs as new evidence warrants. Who knows: Maybe this strange evolution from partial truth to full prevarication gives an indication that, somehow, Moore conscience is warring with itself. Either way, his willingness to move to full - fledged dishonesty helps undermine his onetime semi - believable denials of the worst of the charges against him. One fib does not prove that his other statements are lies, of course, but it does establish that he is not entirely trustworthy. Here is the obvious lie (the part before the \"and\" repeated twice in recent days, from church pulpits: Let me state once again: I do not know any of these women, did not date any of these women and have not engaged in any sexual misconduct with anyone. If he said it just once, it could be attributable to a mere lack of clarity: Maybe he meant he did not know the women he had not already admitted to knowing. But when he said it twice, and insisted he neither knew nor dated \"any\" of them, he was committing a bald - faced lie. How do we know? We know, first, because he himself told us so. Here was Roy Moore talking to Fox Sean Hannity a few days after the disturbing allegations came out emphases added: I do recognize however the names of two these young ladies, Debbie Wesson and Gloria Thacker, which they have a maiden, that their maiden name... I seem to know or remember knowing Wesson parents... that they were friends. I ca recall the specific dates because that been __int_2__ years but I remember her as a good girl. HANNITY: But do you remember ever going on a date with her? She said that you asked around out on the first of several dates but nothing progressed beyond kissing. MOORE: I do remember specific dates. I do not and I do remember if it was that time or later. But I do not remember that. HANNITY: But you know hard but you never dated her ever? Is that what you saying? MOORE: No but I do remember going out on dates. I knew her as a friend. If we did go on dates then we did. But I do not remember that. HANNITY: What about Gloria Thacker Deason says she was an __int_2__ year old cheerleader when you began taking her on dates that included bottles bottles rose wine. She __int_2__ at the time. The Alabama drinking age at the time is __int_2__ Did that ever happen? MOORE: No. Because in this county is a dry county. We would never would have had liquor. I would never... I believe this she said that she believed she was under age and as I recall she was __int_2__ or older and that just never happened. I never provided alcohol, beer or intoxicating liquor to a minor. That be against the law and against anything I would have ever done. And I seem to remember her as a good girl or I seem to remember I had some sort of knowledge of her parents, her mother in particular. HANNITY: At that time in your life... Let me ask you this you do remember these girls would it be unusual for you as a __int_2__ year old guy to have dated a woman as young as __int_2__ That would be a __int_2__ year difference or a girl __int_2__ Do you remember dating girls that young at that time? MOORE: Not generally, no. If did, you know, I not going to dispute anything but I do remember anything like that. HANNITY: But you do specifically remember having any girlfriend that was in her late teens even at that time? MOORE: I do remember that and I do remember ever dating any girl without the permission of her mother. And I think in her statement she said that her mother actually encouraged her to go out with me. So Moore remembers them both as good girls, remembers the parents of both, recalls that one was __int_2__ or older (she says she was __int_2__ knew one of them \"as a friend, and ca deny having actually dated them (but said there was no sexual activity) Yet now, just weeks later, he insists he neither knew nor dated \"any\" of these women, not even the ones whose parents' permission for dating he acknowledged requesting (and whose surviving parents confirm that he asked) This is splitting hairs. This is an unequivocal contradiction not only of the stories of multiple young women, but of his own earlier account. And now one of those women, Debbie Wesson Gibson, has produced absolutely compelling evidence that she and Moore were indeed friendly. A scrapbook from her high school days, easily verifiable as dating from then and as having not been altered, contains references to her having gone on dates with Moore and features a note he wrote her congratulating her for graduating high school. This personal scrapbook is far more compelling than the somewhat dubious, single - entry note allegedly written by Moore in another girl yearbook (although a hand - writing expert confirms what untrained eyes also see, which is that the bulk of the yearbook message is written in a hand remarkably similar to the writing featured in the note to Wesson Gibson) A court of law would accept the scrapbook as evidence of some sort of friendly association between Moore and Wesson. But now Moore says he not only never went on a date with her (she had described him fondly as playing the guitar and reading poetry for her) but never even knew her. It would have been so easy to say what he started to say to Hannity: Yes, he did on some occasions date older teenage girls, with their parents' knowledge, and he acted like a gentleman and never did anything inappropriate with them. He could distinguish those instances from the worse allegations against him, and trust the public to adjudge the stories and his believability for themselves. Instead, he is falsely denying even the most innocent of all the \"accusations\" against him. He is lying after having had weeks to think about it. He is not miss - speaking out of the haze of memory newly jarred, but rather putting forth a falsehood with deliberate intent. These new untruths are counterproductive. They hurt, not help, his case that he did bring to his house, partially disrobe, and fondle - old Leigh Corfman. By usual standards, remember, Corfman claims are at least credible. Her mother confirms their meeting of Moore at the courthouse. Court records confirm the mother and daughter were there at the time. The mother confirms that their home phone cord was long enough to stretch into Leigh room and that Leigh took private calls there. Public records (despite Moore team claims to the contrary) confirm they lived where they said they did. And, to quote the original summation by the Washington Post, Two of Corfman childhood friends say she told them at the time that she was seeing an older man, and one says Corfman identified the man as Moore. Wells says her daughter told her about the encounter more than a decade later, as Moore was becoming more prominent as a local judge. One of those two friends actually recalled specific details of the second Moore encounter that Corfman told her, which match Corfman current account. Meanwhile, other contemporaneous witnesses support several of the other (non - Corfman) stories, including one mother who quite explicitly says Moore asked permission to date her daughter when the daughter was just __int_2__ the mother refused) Instead of asserting a sort of gray area among different types of interactions with teens of various ages, Roy Moore is now insisting against all evidence and common sense that all of it, every bit, is a false smear born of a grand conspiracy. This column has gone to great lengths to credit some of Moore stories, to give him some benefit of the doubt, and to defend him from unfair charges; and in other forums I have defended him as well against some of the accusations against him of financial improprieties. But if the man wants us to believe him, he darn well should stop telling lies.\n"

      "SAVANNAH, Ga. (WSAV) As the holiday season approaches, it expected to be the happiest time of the year filled with family, friends and fun. But, for so many, it far from happy. In fact, it just the opposite. For Patricia Middleton of Savannah, it hard to see the holidays as a time to celebrate. \"It just sadness. You smile and you go about your daily business, but it like a homesickness that just settles on the inside. It very subtle and it sneaks up on you, Middleton told WSAV Ben Katko. Her father died years ago just before Thanksgiving, and she lost her grandmother some years ago around Halloween. She has a daughter who is married and pregnant that lives in Oregon. On top of that, her mother and brother are also out - of - town. For the most part, Middleton is alone in the Coastal Empire. \"It really hard. You see families out and enjoying themselves and getting ready for the holidays, and it sad. I feel lonely sometimes, Middleton said. The truth of the matter is that her feelings are all that uncommon. \"Anywhere from __int_2__ to __int_2__ percent of the population experiences depression at some point in their life. The question is, Why? according to Dr. Edward Drohan. He a licensed psychologist at Memorial Health Medical Center. Around the holiday season, it has little to do with how much you do have in your life, but rather, what you do have. \"Situations act as cues. It reminds us of times past. People gone. Relationships lost, Drohan said. That what happens to Middleton emotions this time each year. \"They were worse when my dad passed. He made the best ham. Oh, he could cook! It funny. It such a small thing, but you just miss small things, Middleton said. \"I miss being able to call him and talk to him about the holidays, or just talk to him about daily life. You just want him back. Over the years, she has figured out how to take hold of her feelings, to some degree. She has sought professional help, but it something else that gets her through. She spends her holidays with other people by giving back in her community. \"What I do is try to connect with other people. There are so many places here in Savannah in the community that need volunteers, Middleton told WSAV. It may be easier than you think to find a way to overcome these strong holiday - driven feelings. Reports and experts suggest: Find somewhere to volunteer. Start a new tradition. Do give in to holiday pressures it okay to refuse an invitation. Do try to do too much it okay if everything is perfect. It okay to seek professional help. \"It important to, number one, recognize what happening with you and then, the second is, to take an inventory of your emotions and what you feeling on a daily basis, and if you find yourself feeling more sad or depressed, or if you find yourself unable to shake off that anxiety, it is important to seek help, said Michelle Aycock, a Savannah - based licensed psychotherapist. For Patricia Middleton, she trying to help people understand that while you may feel lonely, you not really alone. \"A lot of people feel like you the only one. I the only person that feels this way. You not. There are so many other people that feel the exact same way, she said. It those feelings that, year after year, she determined to overcome. \"Sometimes you sadder than other times. If you need help, go get help. There is no shame in that, Middleton said.\n",

      "Hoppy Commentary January __int_1__ at I suspect many West Virginia University football fans have followed with great interest (or at least morbid curiosity) the news about Rich Rodriguez and the University of Arizona. The school fired him Tuesday night following an unremarkable six seasons and amid a sex scandal. Rodriguez 'former administrative assistant, Melissa Wilhelmsen has accused the coach of sexual harassment. According to the claim, Rodriguez made unwanted sexual advances toward Wilhelmsen and also pressured her to help keep his wife, Rita, from finding out about an affair he was having with another woman. Rodriguez vehemently denies the sexual harassment allegations, calling them \"baseless and false, but he admits to the affair. A University investigation found that the allegations \"could not be substantiated based on the evidence and the witnesses available. Wilhelmsen did not cooperate with the investigation. However, the University determined that the \"direction and climate of the football program\" were cause for concern and led to the firing. Arizona is expected to pay Rodriguez his __float_1__ million buyout. Just eleven years ago, Rich Rodriguez had it all going his way. He was coming off a __int_2__ regular season and was one of the hottest coaches in the country. Alabama came calling, and Mountaineer fans were ecstatic when Rodriguez turned down the job. I was camped outside the team meeting room in the Puskar Center and heard the cheers when Rodriguez told the team he was staying. At last, Mountaineer Nation had a homeboy so committed to the Gold and Blue that not even the storied Crimson Tide program could lure him away. Rodriguez then put an exclamation point on his decision as a Pat White - led Mountaineer team defeated Georgia Tech __int_2__ in the Gator Bowl. Those were good times. But the euphoria was short lived. Rodriguez obsessed over details of his new contract and bemoaned the reluctance of the WVU administration to grant all his wishes. He claimed that he was not supported or valued by the University. The __int_4__ season - ending upset loss to Pitt cost him and WVU a chance for a national championship and threw him into an emotional tailspin. This time when a historic football program called, he accepted, becoming the head coach at the University of Michigan. WVU held Rodriguez to the buyout terms of his contract. Eventually a settlement was reached where he agreed to pay WVU __int_1__ million. The ugly departure angered Mountaineer fans, who felt betrayed. For several years Autumn Saturday meant rooting for WVU to win and Michigan to lose. After getting canned at Michigan and then settling in at Arizona, I sensed some of the animosity Mountaineer fans felt toward him began to fade. You even heard chatter from some who wanted to bring him back to Morgantown. So now what do we make of Rich Rod? Even if the harassment allegations are untrue, he has admitted to an extramarital affair. That hardly unique among adults, but the totality of the circumstances, combined with a middling record and a pending retention bonus created a weight from which he could not escape in Tucson. Rich, like all of us, is flawed, but his flaws are almost Shakespearean... traits that cause errors in judgment that lead not only to mistakes, but to inglorious downfalls. I heard many Mountaineer fans wonder over the years what would have happened if Rich had stayed. The initial thought is that the favorite son and Mountaineer football would have settled in for a long and prosperous run. Maybe, but as the saying goes, Sports do build character; they reveal it. Remember to factor in that truism when speculating about what might have been.\n"

      "Sapiens and Collective Fictions Recently I read Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Harari. The basic thesis of the book is that humans require 'collective fictions' so that we can collaborate in larger numbers than the __int_3__ or so our brains are big enough to cope with by default. Collective fictions are things that do describe solid objects in the real world we can see and touch. Things like religions, nationalism, liberal democracy, or Popperian falsifiability in science. Things that do exist, but when we act like they do, we easily forget that they do. Collective Fictions in IT Waterfall This got me thinking about some of the things that bother me today about the world of software engineering. When I started in software __int_2__ years ago, God was waterfall. I joined a consultancy (ca. __int_3__ people) that wrote very long specs which were honed to within an inch of their life, down to the individual Java classes and attributes. These specs were submitted to the customer (God knows what they made of it) who signed it off. This was then built, delivered, and monies were received soon after. Life was simpler then and everyone was happy. Except there were gaps in the story customers complained that the spec did match the delivery, and often the product delivered would not match the spec, as' things' changed while the project went on. In other words, the waterfall process was a 'collective fiction' that gave us enough stability and coherence to collaborate, get something out of the door, and get paid. This consultancy went out of business soon after I joined. No conclusions can be drawn from this. Collective Fictions in IT Startups ca. __int_4__ I got a job at another software development company that had a niche with lots of work in the pipe. I was employee __int_2__ There was no waterfall. In fact, there was nothing in the way of methodology I could see at all. Specs were agreed with a phone call. Design, prototype and build were indistinguishable. In fact it felt like total chaos; it was against all of the precepts of my training. There was more work than we could handle, and we got on with it. The fact was, we were small enough not to need a collective fiction we had to name. Relationships and facts could be kept in our heads, and if you needed help, you literally called out to the room. The tone was like this, basically: Of course there were collective fictions, we just did name them: We will never have a mission statement We do need HR or corporate communications, we have the pub (tough luck if you have a family) We only hire the best We got slightly bigger, and customers started asking us what our software methodology was. We guessed it was acceptable to say 'we just write the code' legend had it our C - based application server still in use and blazingly fast was written before my time in a fit of pique with a stash of amphetamines over a weekend. It still in use. Turns out there was this thing called 'Rapid Application Development' that emphasized prototyping. We told customers we did RAD, and they seemed happy, as it was A Thing. It sounded to me like 'hacking' but to be honest I not sure anyone among us really properly understood it or read up on it. As a collective fiction it worked, because it kept customers off our backs while we wrote the software. Soon we doubled in size, moved out of our cramped little office into a much bigger one with bigger desks, and multiple floors. You could shout out your question to the room anymore. Teams got bigger, and these things called 'project managers' started appearing everywhere talking about 'specs' and 'requirements gathering' We tried and failed to rewrite our entire platform from scratch. Yes, we were back to waterfall again, but this time the working cycles were faster and smaller, and the same problems of changing requirements and disputes with customers as before. So was it waterfall? We did really know. Collective Fictions in IT Agile I started hearing the word 'Agile' about __int_4__ Again, I do think I properly read up on it... ever, actually. I got snippets here and there from various websites I visited and occasionally from customers or evangelists that talked about it. When I quizzed people who claimed to know about it their explanations almost invariably lost coherence quickly. The few that really had read up on it seemed incapable of actually dealing with the very real pressures we faced when delivering software to non - sprint - friendly customers, timescales, and blockers. So we carried on delivering software with our specs, and some sprinkling of agile terminology. Meetings were called 'scrums' now, but otherwise it felt very similar to what went on before. As a collective fiction it worked, because it kept customers and project managers off our backs while we wrote the software. Since then I worked in a company that grew to __int_3__ people, and now work in a corporation of employees, but the pattern is essentially the same: which incantation of the liturgy will satisfy this congregation before me? Do You Believe? I not going to beat up on any of these paradigms, because what the point? If software methodologies did exist we have to invent them, because how else would we work together effectively? You need these fictions in order to function at scale. It no coincidence that the Agile paradigm has such a quasi - religious hold over a workforce that is immensely fluid and mobile. (If you want to know what I really think about software development methodologies, read this because it lays it out much better than I ever could. One of many interesting arguments in Sapiens is that because these collective fictions ca adequately explain the world, and often conflict with each other, the interesting parts of a culture are those where these tensions are felt. Often, humour derives from these tensions. 'The test of a first - rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function. Scott Fitzgerald I do know about you, but I often feel this tension when discussion of Agile goes beyond a small team. When I told in a motivational poster written by someone I never met and who knows nothing about my job that I should 'obliterate my blockers' and those blockers are both external and non - negotiable, what else can I do but laugh at it? How can you be agile when there are blockers outside your control at every turn? Infrastructure, audit, security, financial planning, financial structures all militate against the ability to quickly deliver meaningful iterations of products. And who is the customer here, anyway? We talking about the square of despair: When I see diagrams like this representing Agile I can only respond with black humour shared with my colleagues, like kids giggling at the back of a church. When within a smaller and well - functioning functioning team, the totems of Agile often fly out of the window and what you left with (when it good) is a team that trusts each other, is open about its trials, and has a clear structure (formal or informal) in which agreement and solutions can be found and c ð² peration is productive. Google recently articulated this (reported briefly here, and more in - depth here) So Why Not Tell It Like It Is? You might think the answer is to come up with a new methodology that better. It not like we have tried: It just not that easy, like the book says: Telling effective stories is not easy. The difficulty lies not in telling the story, but in convincing everyone else to believe it. Much of history revolves around this question: how does one convince millions of people to believe particular stories about gods, or nations, or limited liability companies? Yet when it succeeds, it gives Sapiens immense power, because it enables millions of strangers to cooperate and work towards common goals. Just try to imagine how difficult it would have been to create states, or churches, or legal systems if we could speak only about things that really exist, such as rivers, trees and lions. Let rephrase that: Coming up with useful software methodologies is not easy. The difficulty lies not in defining them, but in convincing others to follow it. Much of the history of software development revolves around this question: how does one convince engineers to believe particular stories about the effectiveness of requirements gathering, story points, burndown charts or backlog grooming? Yet when adopted, it gives organisations immense power, because it enables distributed teams to cooperate and work towards delivery. Just try to images how difficult it would have been to create Microsoft, Google, or IBM if we could only speak about specific technical challenges. Anyway, does the world need more methodologies? It not like some very smart people have already thought about this. So I cool with it. Lean, Agile, Waterfall, whatever, the fact is we need some kind of common ideology to c ð² perate in large numbers. None of them are evil, so it not like you picking racism over socialism or something. Whichever one you pick is not going to reflect the reality, but if you expect perfection you will be disappointed. And watch yourself for unspoken or unarticulated collective fictions. Your life is full of them. Like that your opinion is important. I ca resist quoting this passage from Sapiens about our relationship with wheat: The body of Homo sapiens had not evolved for farming wheat. It was adapted to climbing apple trees and running after gazelles, not to clearing rocks and carrying water buckets. Human spines, knees, necks and arches paid the price. Studies of ancient skeletons indicate that the transition to agriculture brought about a plethora of ailments, such as slipped discs, arthritis and hernias. Moreover, the new agricultural tasks demanded so much time that people were forced to settle permanently next to their wheat fields. This completely changed their way of life. We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us. The word 'domesticate' comes from the Latin domus, which means' house ' Who the one living in a house? Not the wheat. It the Sapiens. Maybe we not here to direct the code, but the code is directing us. Who the one compromising reason and logic to grow code? Not the code. It the Sapiens.

      "The Rise of Emotionally Intelligent Software Work will be transformed by software designed to augment our empathy. Talk of empathy and emotional intelligence is everywhere these days. It not like this is anything new the skills of emotional intelligence are hard - wired into our brains, they are part of our social fabric, they are a large part of what makes us human. Empathy lets us do something pretty amazing see the world through the eyes of other people. More and more, we are becoming aware of the far - reaching business implications of empathy. The fact is, especially in business, the better we understand people, the better we perform. With some effort, we can step into another shoes and borrow their smarts, skills and experiences. And as this understanding works its way further into the practice of business, it also working its way into business software. Empathy is a core tenet of design thinking. The \"get outside the building\" ethos of the lean startup movement is just another way of encouraging empathy. Even the sophisticated user analytics that are part of most cloud software today are increasing the emotional intelligence of those systems because they create a feedback loop between what the software does and how people react to it. These patterns are causing a shift in focus from software that forces you to \"learn the system, to software that works\" naturally \"alongside us to solve our problems. But this is just the beginning. The next wave of software wo just work with us in an emotionally intelligent way. It will augment our emotional intelligence directly, in much the same way that a spreadsheet augments our mathematical intelligence. Software built to directly use the strengths and support the weaknesses of our emotional intelligence will transform the way we decide and work together. Until recently, the default technology answer to business decision - making has been more data, bigger data, and more analysis of bigger data. That is a perspective birthed in the 'and' when data was scarce and economics was based on the theory that informed people make rational decisions. But 21st century managers are awash in a sea of data. And more importantly, it turns out that last century economists were mostly dead wrong. Led by Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman, today behavioral economists have proven that people are rational. Instead, to borrow a phrase from scientist Dan Ariely, we are \"predictably irrational. And this has huge consequences for data and decision making in business. Give managers more information, especially the ambiguous information so common in business, and they most likely to pick and choose data that tells the story they want to tell, leaving the truth to fend for itself. As for artificial intelligence, algorithms that give decision makers shades of probabilities are usually just adding more ambiguous data to the mix. In many ways, the idea that we are \"predictably irrational\" has been tacitly understood in business forever. Prices end in __int_1__ web buttons are green and salespeople are friendly because customers are irrational. And the ring of the cash register makes it very easy to measure the impact of these tricks on customer decisions. More recently, a similar 'trickster' approach has been brought to bear inside business. It common practice for administrators to use default choices in web forms to nudge employees in the right direction. More and more software greets you with inspiring quotes each day. And although the gamification craze has died down slightly, that mostly because it now de rigeur for software designers to use habit loops, quests, points, badges and other tricks to trigger dopamine squirts that encourage employees to achieve their OKRs or update their leads in a CRM system. These are tricks tacked on to existing systems. But the new apps wo just graft these new ideas onto old. They will birth entirely new systems. Imagine this: A collaboration app that connects people in immediate and open chat streams of shared information. A meditation app that gives people space to step back from immediate pressures. A decision app that guides people through a flow of questions to avoid predictable pitfalls. Of course, you do have to imagine those apps. They are all here, already. The startups building these apps are using design thinking and a deep understanding of real - world human behavior to create simple and friendly solutions for the \"small\" decision - making problems that have big impacts on managers and teams every day. They are building software purposefully designed to augment our emotional intelligence. Much like optometrists measuring our eyes and making glasses so we can see clearly, they are measuring our behavior and making apps so we can work clearly. Because these small solutions make it dramatically easier for people to work together on a daily basis, they unlock big opportunities for fundamental improvements in the way we work. Most importantly, they make it possible to directly measure and create feedback loops for decision making the single most important management activity, the one with the greatest impact on business performance. As a result, this new generation of software will transform business decision making from the bottom up. As these emotionally intelligent systems make it possible to measure our decisions and guide the processes we follow to make them, the results will speak for themselves.\n",

      "Communicating your dietary needs in advance can alleviate tension for everyone involved. The holidays are packed with social gatherings and plenty of food. If you someone who has strict dietary needs because of food sensitivities, it also a time filled with stress. \"Will there be anything I can eat at the party? \"What if the host is offended that I turn down her family recipe? \"Will I be so distracted inspecting the menu that I wo socialize? I first learned I had severe food intolerances about eight years ago. Since then, I followed a strict gluten - free diet. I often feel anxious when I eating food in a different setting whether that a restaurant, a buffet line, or a family member house. I not the only one who struggles to manage dietary restrictions. A __int_4__ survey by Harris Poll, for instance, found that __int_1__ percent of Americans eat vegetarian or vegan diets. Additionally, about __int_1__ percent of Americans have celiac disease a fraction of the estimated __float_1__ million people who follow a gluten - free diet. Some of my most stressful experiences involve eating at the home of a host often a family member who has tried to accommodate my needs but slipped up with a menu item. To be fair, preparing a feast while accounting for food sensitivities is a challenge. People often think they helping me out by avoiding one ingredient they know I can not eat, but they sometimes completely miss another one of my intolerances in the process. For example, I was visiting my aunt a few years ago when she ordered food from an Italian restaurant. She was thrilled to tell me she ordered chicken alfredo instead of pasta, but she did realize that alfredo sauce contains gluten. I had to politely decline the meal, which was an easy task. Thankfully, I learned to prioritize my health over others' feelings. The number of people who eat specialized diets is likely to increase in the coming years. A __int_4__ Mott poll found that one in six parents has a teenager who has tried a vegetarian, gluten - free, vegan, or paleo diet within the past two years. While many of those parents believed the diets were good for their children health, more than half of them said their children dietary needs caused conflict at family gatherings. During nerve - racking holiday gatherings, the last thing most people want is another stressor. Avoiding the Holiday Eating Blues Communicating your dietary needs in advance can alleviate tension for everyone involved. Most hosts want their guests to have pleasant visits, so they will go out of their way to make menu adjustments. In some situations, this is possible. When that the case, it can be helpful to keep a few pointers in mind. Plan ahead so you are stressed out. If you ca communicate your needs ahead of time or if your host is able to accommodate your diet you not completely out of luck. One relatively easy solution is to bring your own dish. This ensures you have at least one thing you can eat, and you be a gracious guest. If cooking is your thing, bring your own snacks to munch on during the party. Alternatively, plan to eat something before the event. A full stomach means you wo have to worry about whether you can eat anything during the party. Eating ahead of time also ensures you be better able to enjoy a few holiday drinks without overdoing it. Prioritize your health over others' feelings. Emotions run high around the holidays, and it easy to feel like food is just another hot - button topic. But you ca let other people feelings get in the way of your health especially if you have food sensitivities. It might feel impossible to reject someone cherished family dish, but a little bit of diplomacy can go a long way. You might resent having to explain your dietary restrictions, but try to be as polite as possible. For example, you might say, Thank you so much for hosting and making this delicious meal. I sadly can not eat some of the ingredients, so I have to pass. Recognize the connection between feeling healthy and having fun. When you first learn you have a food sensitivity or intolerance, following a special diet can seem like a burden. Ultimately, that diet helps prevent more serious health problems. Speaking from experience, following a strict diet eventually feels less like a challenge and more like an opportunity to be your healthiest self. In fact, adhering to your new diet will start to become second nature particularly when you notice how much better it makes you feel. It might not always be easy, but people who have dietary restrictions must plan ahead for holiday events. Communicating your needs and taking steps to ensure you have something to eat can be the difference between revelry and misery. By putting your dietary needs over other people feelings, you can increase the odds of everyone having a happy and healthy holiday season. Shireen Yates is co - founder and chief executive officer of Nima. Since its inception in __int_4__ Nima has worked to create greater food transparency to help consumers make better health decisions; its first product is a discreet and portable device that allows consumers to test their meals for gluten in a few minutes.\n"

      "You must enter the characters with black color that stand out from the other characters Whether it out - of - control drinking games or the latest social media challenge, teens always seem to be into something that makes absolutely no sense at all. This month, it biting into Tide Pods. According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, a growing number of teenagers are choosing to chomp into single - load laundry detergent packets for likes, clicks or views on social media. This week, the country poison control centers issued a \"high alert, reporting that, in the first two weeks of __int_4__ they had handled __int_2__ such cases among __int_2__ to __int_2__ year olds. By the third week of January, that total number had shot up to __int_2__ For all of __int_4__ the centers had handled only __int_2__ cases. \"Since our first alert to this life - threatening activity, the trend of intentionally ingesting single - load laundry packets has increased in its popularity despite repeated warnings, said Stephen Kaminski, the center CEO and executive director, in a press release. \"We can not stress enough how dangerous this is to the health of individuals it can lead to seizure, pulmonary edema, respiratory arrest, coma, and even death. If you or a loved one misuses a laundry packet or has a question about the risk of exposure to one, immediately contact the national Poison Help hotline. That Poison Help hotline number is __int_3__ You also can text Poison to __int_6__ to save the number in your phone. Poison control experts are available __int_2__ hours a day, seven days a week and provide help for free. Meanwhile, Proctor Gamble, the maker of Tide Pods, is working with social media companies to remove the videos and imploring adults to speak with kids about the dangers of eating laundry detergent. The company released a video earlier this month with football player Rob Gronkowski who said, What the heck is going on people? Use Tide Pods for washing, not eating. So, as adults take action to try to curb yet another disturbing trend among teens, parents and others are left to wonder, Why? Why would a teen even considering doing this? Why does eating a Tide Pod seem appealing? Why are teens making such dumb decisions? Why is this even a thing? Well, let remember, teens have been making dumb decisions for centuries. Even in medieval Europe, some scholars believe that unruly teens were sent to live with strangers because it was easier for them to raise them. Others were even contractually required to obey - or face more hard labor if they did live up to expectations, according to a BBC article. Today, the leading cause of death among teens is accidents and unintentional injuries, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It all about the brain development Stephanie Zerwas, psychologist and UNC - Chapel Hill associate professor who specializes in therapy for tweens, teens, and young adults, says it all has a lot to do with brain development. \"Here the deal: Having a teenager is like having a two - year - old again. Their emotions are bigger than they ever have been before - or maybe not since they were two. They are feeling such depths of sadness and such happiness. The volume on everything has gotten turned up to __int_2__ Zerwas said. Our brains are fully developed until we __int_2__ or __int_2__ Zerwas said. And, during this period of our lives, the emotion centers of our brains, the parts that regulate emotion, are on fire, Zerwas said. That would be fine if another part of the brain, the frontal lobe, which sort of acts like the boss and is charge of the brain executive function, was on the job. But it is. It has fully developed yet, Zerwas said. \"If the frontal lobe could override those big emotions, that would be awesome, she said. \"Unfortunately for us, at the same time their emotions are getting so big, that part of their brain goes offline. Historically, these undeveloped brains were just what our society needed when people left their homes and married at very young ages. \"Historically, we did wait to get married until we were __int_2__ Zerwas said. \"We would start partnering up in this period of time. Find a partner, go out, leave our society and do something new and leave the protective embrace of our family. And that made sense back then. Our bodies have not caught up to modern life. Social media fuels the fire Kids' constant access to friends and peers only fuels their decisions to take part in questionable activities. Zerwas points to an experiment that found that teens taking part in a virtual driving game took riskier actions when they thought friends or peers were watching. (Zerwas recommends reading this __int_4__ New Yorker article to learn more about that experiment and also teen brain development. \"If you think your peers are watching you, adults get cautious, but teens start doing really stupid stuff, Zerwas said. \"They are more impulsive. They are more likely to run that red light. In the past, if you left your teen at home, they might not have access to everyone else. Now, because they have a phone in their pocket, they have access to all of their friends and a perceived audience. That the reason this type of behavior catches on. Bottom line, said Zerwas: If you want to create a recipe for a really risky situation for a teenager, give theme access to something that seems like it cool and put lots of friends around them. What a parent to do? Help your teens by being their manager, Zerwas said - acting as the frontal lobe of their brain, which just is up to the task right now. She recommends these eight strategies for helping your teen steer clear of risky and dangerous behavior. Talk to your teenager. Talk to them about whatever is in the headlines whether it the Tide Pod challenge now, a teen driving death or any other risky behavior that they might seem cool in the moment. Tell them where you stand on the subject. And do think you one and done with this conversation. Have these discussions on a regular basis. Know your teenager. Not every teenager wants to eat Tide Pods or take part in some risky social media challenge, Zerwas said. For some, just making them aware about what teens might be up to and knowing where you stand, is all they need to steer clear. For others, you need to lock up your Tide Pods. Think: For my son or my daughter, what is the threat level that they may do something like this? That will guide what action you take, she said. Tell them about their brain development. Let them know what happening to their frontal lobe right now - and other parts of their brain. Tell them why they feeling so much emotion and joy and, at times, despair. \"Teenagers think, I going to feel like this for the rest of my life. This is what my future looks like - having these giant emotions and feeling impulses, Zerwas said. \"Some of it is just saying this is going to feel like this always. This is partly a side effect of the fact that you are __int_2__ But do tell them it all bad when it comes to their brain. \"There are real advantages to this part of your life as well, she said. \"That those feelings of romantic love are so intense or friendships can seem so meaningful and deep. Or that a movie can feel like the most beautiful thing you have ever seen. You are feeling this world so deeply, and that awesome. But it also means there is liability along the way. Encourage risk - the healthy kind. Author Michelle Icard, a Charlotte - based expert on the middle school years, writes about the need to encourage healthy risks among tweens and teens. Kids fill up their need for thrill and excitement by, for instance, trying out for the school play or signing up for an Outward Bound week, instead of playing a drinking game or biting into a Tide Pod. Zerwas agrees with Icard. \"There are ways to encourage them to get this risk taking out in a safer way, she said. \"Some kids might really need that sense of adventure or sense of thrill. Do they need to try rocking climbing? Even standing on stage and trying to do improv in front of others. Let them have a sense of adventure, just not when they unsupervised and there is a phone there and a stack of Tide Pods in the laundry room. Monitor what your kid is posting online. \"Do take their word for granted, Zerwas said. \"And I do mean just follow them on Instagram. I mean have their login information. It not that you do trust them. It that you do trust all of the other people around them. And there will be a time for privacy, but it going to be that they have to show you that they earned it and that you trust their decisions. Take away all phones and electronics at night. Lock them up if necessary. \"I always recommend taking away phones, iPads, computers, she said. \"Electronics get locked up at night. Otherwise, you are giving a conduit to constant friends around your kids all of the time. Just like you would let your kids go out all night, you should let them have this much access to their phones all of the time. Help your kids with a script \"Peer approval and peer opinion is so important at this age - more than any other point in your life, Zerwas said. \"So part of leadership as a teen is trying to set that tone for peer approval. When you talk to your kid, it also about helping them set a context for their friends. If it perceived in a group that it uncool to eat Tide Pods and that it the stupidest thing they ever heard about, it likely they wo give it a try. But, on the other hand, if the group thinks it funny and it becomes normalized, they might head to your laundry room. This might be easier said than done, but Zerwas recommends looking for the leaders among your child circle of friends. It might be your child. It might be another teen, who is influential among their peers. If you know who that kid is, Zerwas recommends seeking them out to influence how they - and the group - feel about a particular topic. But, be careful. \"It could backfire, she said. \"You have to really know who that kid is. In fact, appealing to teens' leaders is where Proctor Gamble and other groups seeking to stop the Tide Pod challenge could really make an impact, Zerwas said. NFL star Gronkowski, while famous, is going to cut it with this crowd. They need to \"recruit the most influential Youtuber to talk about how this is negative, she said. \"If that sets the tone, then everything else will fall.\n"

      "CHARLESTON, WV (This week, bills will drop in the West Virginia House and Senate to add sexual orientation and gender identity to the state hate crime law. LGBT advocates have been pushing for the change since a old gay man in Marion County was beaten to death in __int_4__ But supporters say they believe this could be the year West Virginia changes it law. According to data released just two months ago from the FBI, in __int_4__ more than people were attacked because of their sexual orientation, and __int_3__ for their gender identity. With hate crimes up __int_2__ overall in __int_4__ human rights advocates say now is the time to protect all West Virginians. In April __int_4__ Steward Butler attacked a gay couple on a Huntington sidewalk. Then just four months ago, he was sentenced to six months in jail. Prosecutors were hoping for a longer sentence, but they could charge Butler with a hate crime because sexual orientation is covered in state law. \"Passenger in a car that was stopped at a stop light ran out of the car and punched them and assaulted simply because they were holding hands, Fairness West Virginia Executive Director Andrew Schneider told __int_2__ News. Schneider said these problems are going away, so he believes West Virginia lawmakers need to act now and add sexual orientation and gender identity to the state hate crime statute. \"So my community, the LGBT community, no longer has to live in fear in West Virginia, Schneider added. So this week, Ron Walters will propose a bill in the House and Richard Ojeda in the Senate. \"You ca do that if you do agree with their religion, race, creed, things like that. So I think we need to go ahead and put that blanket of protection over the LGBT community as well, Senator Ojeda explained. What makes the bill different this year is breaking the law would add jail time, but would require community service and education. \"We think that people are born with hatred in their heart, it something that they learned, and it something they can un - learn. Through restorative justice process, you really examine what the victim of the crime and the community targeted needs to be made whole, Joseph Cohen explained. Cohen is the Executive Director of the ACLU West Virginia chapter. He said this approach has worked in other states to break the cycle of hatred and violence.

      "DR. REEDER: Tom, I going to be over there while this program is airing. People ask me, Why do you go there? It a principle I learned in my own life and I use it in teaching others: If you can get direct access to the environment to where things occur, you pull in all of your senses when it comes time to learn and that enhances your learning you get insight while you on - site. Later last week, we found that, indeed, while there were a number of Palestinians protesting, they were infiltrated by a number of terrorists and, in fact, there video evidence that Hamas was paying children to be involved in that group and some of those children lost their lives. Harry, in the aftermath of what happened on that day, there were, as we talked about, a number of Palestinians that were trying to breech the security border fence in Israel and they were pushed back by Israeli soldiers. A number of Palestinians were killed. TOM LAMPRECHT: Harry, last week, we talked about the opening of the new embassy in Jerusalem by the United States. Guatemala, later in the week, also moved their embassy from Tel - Aviv to Jerusalem. As we are spending the time there, we go to the various places. I have a wonderful guide that goes before us and checks all the logistics and then makes her statements about the area. She very knowledgeable and then she steps back. And then I start going into connecting the dots Old Testament, New Testament, what happened here, why it happen here and the providence of God. I take people to the city of Naan that where Jesus raised the boy who was being carried out of the city. I actually have found the place where that occurred and, not long after that, interestingly, an archaeological team working from the United States working in Israel found that the gates of the city were actually right there. And the way I found it is I found the ruins of an old church that used to be there, knowing that, early on, they would build churches on sites where certain things had occurred. That how I found it and then archeology, there was a big article on this in Biblical Archeological Review, they begin to dig and, sure enough, they found out that here where the gates of Naan were. Now, there a lot of reasons to weep when your only son died if you a widow. In the surrounding societies, widows lost their legitimacy of existence when their husband died. What could preserve them is their children, in general, but the firstborn male, in particular. Therefore, with her husband gone and her child gone, if she actually had been in another country, many of them, they just put them out and let them die or even, in some cases, put them to death because such women were considered as a burden upon society and no longer a productive member of society. In Israel, that was not the case because the Lord had embedded the dignity of women into the ceremonial laws, in general, and the Law of God, in particular: Honor your father and your mother. \"Do not commit adultery\" the sanctity of marriage and, therefore, the wife position in a marriage, that a wife was not just property. He raises the boy and she got a lot of reason for joy and the people are amazed and they say, He a prophet. What a lot of people do realize is that there was a great prophet by the name of Elisha and that is the very area where he ministered. He, of course, raised a widow son as an affirmation that he had followed Elijah, who raises a widow son. And, right there in that very area, they would be fully aware of that, very sensitive to that story and, when Jesus comes in and raises up the widow son in that same area, no wonder they cry out, This is the prophet of whom we have waited. What you can see is the amazing connecting of dots of all that takes place in this rather small country, about the size of New Jersey. TOM LAMPRECHT: And, Harry, as we look at Israel and the miracles that took place some of the stories that you just shared with us just now, yet today it seems to be somewhat of a powder keg ready to go off at any moment. Harry, is that coincidental or is there a spiritual implication there? DR. REEDER: We constantly amazed at how accurate the Bible is, both what it has recorded as history and then what it prophesies as history. Prophecy in the Bible is pre - written history and God has already told us of these conflicts that are going to be there, the conflicts that are going to exist throughout the world, and the particular conflicts that are going to be there in terms of the enmity of the nations. Now we should, as believers, always pray for the peace of Jerusalem, we should always promote peace in the area and we need to deal justly with all sides in the conflict that is there. And you need to remember that you have brothers and sisters who are Jewish, who are in Christ and know the Lord, and you have brothers and sisters who are Palestinian who are in Christ and know the Lord. Therefore, we always laboring for that peace in the area. However, Tom, while I there, I hope to let people see their Bible come alive and then, when we get back, I get people writing me all the time, Can I tell you what that means? My Bible now is so alive when I read it because I was right there, getting insight while you on - site. One of the places that the people will go is the Golan Heights and, when we go there, we be looking over into Syria. Not only is there tension on the southern border of Hamas and Egypt and the Gaza, but there also, as you know, quite a bit of tension with Syria because Syria has become a proxy for Iran and Iran has already attempted some incursions. We be taking a look from the observation post that they allow you to look from. While we there, we going to share Christ with people and we going to pray for Israel. Let me just also say, Tom, that __int_2__ years ago, it was less than __int_1__ percent of Jewish people confessed Christ as Lord and Savior. It is now believed that they rising up to __int_1__ percent. Now, that does sound like much, but that is an extensive multiplication. There also some evidence within the military of an underground movement of the Gospel taking place in the Israeli country and there have been a number of churches that have been able to secure some freedoms that Christian churches have not enjoyed in the past but now do enjoy, which then has opened up other doors in ministry as well. When I pray for the peace of Jerusalem, I not only pray, certainly, for the peace among the nations and the ethnicities, but I also want to pray very specifically for the Gospel of Peace so that men and women can be right with God through the redeeming work of Jesus Christ, filled with the Spirit of God. When you filled with the Spirit of God, then you have the fruit of the Spirit love, and joy, and peace, and patience, and kindness, and goodness and faithfulness, and gentleness and self - control and then pray that the Gospel of saving grace in Christ that brings men and women at peace with God would promote their peace with one another and then, in fact, reach out in peace, certainly not to the detriment of the security of the nation, but in order to promote the security of the nation. And I do pray that, somehow in some way, God uses our country here, America, as a part of both of those desires that I pray for. One part is that America will have believers who are praying for and sending those who can share the Gospel throughout the land of Israel. And, secondly, that the leadership of our nation might be able to assist in some way to bring a political, and national and ethnic peace among the peoples that are there but, all the while, seeing that movement of the Gospel of peace of Jesus Christ and the redemptive work of Christ bringing the true shalom shalom, that wonderful word of peace. TOM LAMPRECHT: Harry, on tomorrow edition of Today in Perspective, I want to take you to a report that was released by the New York Times last week which ought to be somewhat concerning for all of us. It really describes how the separation of the three branches of our government are starting to erode. DR. REEDER: Not only is it the law that is king in America not any individual or any one branch of government but how that wisdom needs to be embraced once again.

      "The labour movement should demand that not just Carillion, but all the big public service contractors, Serco, Capita, should be nationalised with minimum compensation, and their public contracts brought back in - house. Their workers - including agency staff and formally - self - employed contractors - should be brought into union - negotiated public - sector pay and conditions, and the services should be run under the democratic control of the workers and elected public authorities. We must demand damage limitation for Carillion workers. Carillion public - sector contracts should be taken in - house, and its private - sector contracts taken into public ownership. Carillion employees in social housing maintenance in Northern Ireland voted unanimously at a union meeting on __int_2__ January to demand direct employment by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Most of Carillion work in Northern Ireland is for the Housing Executive. Carillion has many employees on contracts in Canada and the Middle East as well as its in the UK: we should support the Canadian labour movement in fighting to save the jobs in Canada, and demand the British government take over the contracts in the Middle East and run them under union - negotiated conditions. With Carillion, this is all damage limitation. Carillion, like the other big \"services companies\" is different from how we usually imagine big capitalist corporations. It has very little fixed capital. It hires or leases equipment and offices, contract by contract. The wealth created by its workers' labour over the years is not crystallised into solid fixed assets which can be seized for redress. It has all already been siphoned off into dividend pay - outs and huge salaries and bonuses for the top bosses. Carillion bosses have put it into \"compulsory liquidation\" Usually bankrupt companies go into \"administration\" where an outside official takes control, sells off some assets, negotiates with the creditors, and tries to refloat the company, usually chopping jobs and demanding wage and pension concessions from the remaining workers. Compulsory liquidation is different: the outside official, the Official Receiver, has no remit but to sell off assets, wind up operations, and pay the creditors whatever fraction can be raised of what due to them. The Carillion shareholders who failed to pocket their fat dividends from the good years and walk away in time have already lost everything, so nationalising Carillion without compensating them is of little consequence. As much as possible should be clawed back from the Carillion bosses. KPMG, the giant accountancy firm that certified Carillion as in good health only months ago, should be fined or expropriated. But what the media say is true: the taxpayer \"will have to pay much of the cost of saving the services worked by Carillion, the jobs on its contracts, the jobs in supply companies owed money by Carillion, the Carillion workers' pensions. Only, the labour movement should demand that the rich be taxed - that the rich \"taxpayer\" not workers, cover the costs. The cream has been skimmed off and consumed years ago. The lessons will have been learned only if the whole system of doing public contracts through private profiteers is ended. \"Outsourcing\" has been endemic since the 1980s Stable, often well - unionised, public - sector workforces are broken up and the workers dispersed to a variety of contractors. Pressure on the workers to concede worse pay and conditions is kept up by periodic reallocation of the contracts. The work is done in a cheapskate, cost - cutting way. Generally the contractors do not face the same market pressures to get out a decent product that companies selling day - to - day to each other, or to the public, do. The ideological spin is that \"outsourcing\" means that every firm narrows down to its \"core competencies\" and each job is done by firms best qualified for it, rather than every firm or public enterprise doing a diverse range of operations. In fact, jobs are hived off to giant conglomerates with no \"core competency\" at all other than money - grabbing. The profits are often juicy, as they have been for all the big \"service companies\" in Britain with the PFI schemes which flourished under the New Labour government. The Blacklist Support Group of blacklisted construction workers reports: Carillion admitted in the High Court that they blacklisted workers who complained about safety on their building sites, while at the same time milking public sector contracts for millions... In any civilised society, these people Carillion bosses would be facing criminal charges. \"When you invite blacklisting human rights abusers to run the NHS and school meals, do be surprised when vampire capitalism attempts to suck the taxpayer dry\" The profits are not \"ploughed back\" into fixed investments. A lot is paid out in dividends or in bonuses to bosses. Long - term PFI incomes, for example, are often \"cashed out\" quickly by selling the entitlements on to another company. The portion \"ploughed back\" is used to expand not by raising technology but by buying other companies, as Carillion bought up McAlpine, Mowlem, etc. Long periods of public - service cuts put pressure on the firms. In those periods, the bosses turn them into a sort of \"Ponzi scheme\" to keep the flow of bonuses and dividends going. As the Financial Times explained, Carillion \"had, in effect, become a lawful sort of Ponzi scheme - using new or expected revenues to cover more pressing demands for payment\" The company took out more loans, wrote new future contract revenues into its books to back up those loans, stretched its delays in paying suppliers, and kept on claiming profitability and making big pay - outs. According to former Lib - Dem pensions minister Steve Webb, Carillion dividend pay - out \"increased in each of the __int_2__ years since the formation of the company\" As late as last May, Carillion boss Richard Howson declared that the company had made \"an encouraging start to the year\" with \"increased revenue visibility\" The accountants KPMG pocketed their ample fees and smilingly confirmed his story. Within a couple of months Howson evidently recognised that the gig was up. He resigned, having gained __float_1__ million in pay and bonuses for __int_4__ He got a deal saying he would still be paid his base salary until October __int_4__ and the company changed its rules to guarantee such payments to ex - bosses in all circumstances short of legally - proven gross misconduct. Howson successor Keith Cochrane, and former finance chiefs Richard Adam and Zafar Khan, have similar deals. Even if Howson, Adam, and Khan will now fail to get their future promised payments, Howson has already had or so of his pay - out. The Labour front bench statement on Carillion was disappointingly weak: It has been clear for months that Carillion has been in difficulty but the Government has continued to hand over contracts to the company even after profits warnings were issued. \"Jobs and public services are now at risk because the Tories were blinded by their commitment to a failing ideological project of introducing the profit motive into taxpayer - funded services. \"Labour urges the Government to stand ready to intervene and bring these crucial public sector contracts back in - house in order to protect Carillion employees, pension holders and British taxpayers\" It not just Carillion. Bring all the big contracted - out operations back in - house!\n",

      "Of Course Florida School Shooter Was A Girl - Hating White Supremacist. Of Course I Am Tired Of Writing This Article. Add to Flipboard Magazine. A few hours after the final body count of the latest school shooting was tallied, it came out: Nikolas Cruz, the shooter, had been known to \"harass\" women, known to abuse his ex - girlfriend, and was kicked out of school for getting into a fight with his ex - girlfriend. Before long he was being cheered on by the sociopaths over on __netloc__ K board, and Reddit new incel community r braincels. This is what happens now. I wrote this article when Elliot Rodger shot up Isla Vista, and I wrote it again when Christopher Harper - Mercer shot up Umpqua Community College. Twice. Each time it happens the same way: Some man with clear issues with women goes on a murder spree, and each time he is cheered as a hero on misogynistic forums. We know now that Cruz was a Trump supporter who often wore a MAGA hat, that he was known to say horrible things about Muslims, that he attended paramilitary training with Republic of Florida, a white supremacist group hoping to create a \"white ethnostate\" in Florida. (UPDATE: While the white supremacist in charge of a Tallahassee group confirmed Cruz participation to the AP and ADL, his statement is now being seriously questioned, and law enforcement has found no linkage between the two. He was given a gun, though not the one he eventually used to murder __int_2__ children at his old school, by someone in that group. Also, according to someone in that group, he was \"having trouble with a girl\" and that his choice to go on a killing spree on Valentine Day was not a coincidence. We know now that he publicly fantasized about killing Antifa: We know now that he was a \"fan\" of Elliot Rodger. Cruz was full of hate and resentment. Hate for non - white people, hate for \"Antifa, hate for the people at his school, hate for women. Hate, likely, for anyone he saw as getting in the way of what he thought he was entitled to. In my previous work on the subject of misogynistic mass shooters, I focused largely on the fact that these men feel they are entitled to women ideally virginal supermodels and lash out at the world, violently, because they do get them. In __int_4__ I wrote: Elliot Rodger was the product of a culture that teaches male entitlement. Men are entitled to women, to sex, to jobs, to money and if they do get them, then women are to blame. He felt entitled to all these things and was livid over not getting them. You do see women committing crimes like this because we are not taught to feel entitled to these things. I still believe this is true. I believe it applies, as well, to angry whites who feel that people of color are to blame for their not getting the things they believe they are entitled to. But the thing is it has always been true and yet we did have quite so many mass murders. We need to ask ourselves what has changed? That guns, particularly assault rifles, are more easily available now is certainly a contributing factor, but there are also cultural and social factors that we need to start addressing. In the 1970s if you thought Ted Bundy was a hero for murdering all those women, you kept that to yourself. You could just casually say, Wow, that guy had a POINT! to someone or else people would think you were nuts. You could go on a YouTube video and post about how great he was. Today, people who feel that way can find each other, they can commiserate without being judged. They can talk online about how much they would really like to murder a bunch of women. They get to cherish their resentments, nurture them and watch them grow. Like a cult leader going from prophet to messiah to Literal Jesus, the insular nature of these groups creates a need for constant escalation. Someone may stop by one of these forums because they are having a bad day, because they feel slighted in some way, or because their crush would go out with them and they feel bad, and eventually get so sucked into these communities that instead of dealing with these common life events in a healthy way, they start one - upping each other to the point where they fantasize about murdering people. They start out being \"I not a racist but... types and end up dreaming about a white ethnostate and praising Hitler. They lose touch with reality. Socialization is not innate, it is learned and the fact that more of it is being learned on the internet these days rather than in - person has consequences. It easier to see other people as NPCs who do feel the same way you do, it easier to dismiss their humanity when most of your interaction with them is on social media, where most people are pretending to have a fabulous and perfect life. Even when they not putting on that facade, even if they angsty as hell, it still just words on a page. It also just words on a page when you just sitting around trolling people, or trying to purposely hurt people, when you spend hours in misogynistic and racist forums dehumanizing women and men you think are better looking than you are and have more dates, dehumanizing people of other races and religion. It creates a certain kind of solipsism, a feeling that only your own feelings are real, that other people emotions and inner lives are no more real than those of people on television shows. That makes misogyny easier, it makes racism easier, it makes violence easier. It does help that, in some sections of the internet, there is a culture in which cruelty is currency. This is part of the reason why Trump won because people like Cruz delighted in his cruelty. He is cheered on these same toxic forums for his ability to \"troll\" people and \"trigger the libs. Trump was the nail in the coffin of basic human decency actually meaning something. Trump won because too many people have become inured to cruelty. We need to consider the fact that maybe some things need to be taught that did used to need to be taught. Instincts that were once perhaps tempered by things as simple as \"hanging out\" with other people are no longer being tempered. Those who are socially inept do get the practice they need to overcome it, they do learn how to relate to people, to read body language and facial expressions. Young men do learn how to relate to or talk to women like actual human beings. They do learn how to be masculine, or how to express their anger or emotions, in a healthy way. This is part of what we talk about when we talk about \"toxic masculinity. Contrary to what conservatives and anti - feminists think, this is not feminists saying \"being a man is bad and toxic! BOO MEN! No one is saying that. (Okay, very few people are saying that. What we are saying is that a lot of the attributes we ascribe to masculinity are unhealthy and, quite frankly, just as bad for men as they are for women. Statistically, men are vastly less likely to seek therapy for mental issues than are women, largely because doing so is perceived as weak and unmanly. Men are expected to be violent, to be sexual conquistadors, to not have emotions other than anger. A woman rejecting them, breaking up with them, is not just a heartbreak, but a perceived threat to their masculinity, to their very identity. Ease of access to guns, toxic masculinity, white resentment and a lack of in - person socialization are a deadly combination. In Italy, where femicide and domestic violence has become an extremely serious problem, some schools have started implementing what amounts, essentially, to \"do kill your girlfriend\" classes in which young men are taught, through role - playing and texts, how to handle romantic conflict without resorting to violence. Perhaps something similar needs to be implemented in our own schools. Maybe we actually do need \"classes\" where young men can talk and role - play and learn healthy ways of responding to their own anger and resentment, healthy ways of interacting with people in real life. It may sound like a too touchy - feely response to the horror of mass shootings, to the poison of misogyny and racism, but something has to be done. Quite frankly, we clearly need to teach them how to live in and adjust to a world where being a white man does afford them the privilege it once did. If that not a thing that can \"work\" then we need to figure out something else. Because whatever we doing now, it clearly not working.\n"

      "The NCAA has opened an investigation into Michigan State University handling of sexual abuse allegations against sports doctor Larry Nassar. Nassar has pleaded guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct, and admitted to sexually assaulting young girls when he treated campus athletes and members of the USA Gymnastics. Prominent Olympians including Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney, have said they were abused by Nassar. In a statement, the NCAA said it looking into whether the university violated any rules. \"The NCAA has sent a letter of inquiry to Michigan State University regarding potential NCAA rules violations related to the assaults Larry Nassar perpetrated against girls and young women, including some student - athletes at Michigan State, the NCAA said in a statement. It did not provide additional details. Jason Cody, a spokesman for Michigan State, said the university is reviewing the letter for a response. More than __int_3__ young women have faced Nassar in court as he awaits his sentence. University president, Lou Anna Simon, has recently come under fire for what critics say is mishandling of the scandal. Several victims said they reported Nassar behavior to the university years ago, but that they were either silenced or officials did nothing to end the abuse. \"Michigan State University, the school I loved and trusted, had the audacity to tell me that I did not understand the difference between sexual assault and a medical procedure, survivor Amanda Thomashow said last week. Michigan State maintains no official believed Nassar committed sexual abuse until newspapers began reporting on the allegations during the summer of __int_4__ Any suggestion that the university engaged in a cover - up is \"simply false, the university said in a statement. Simon has expressed support for the women who spoken out against Nassar, but said she has no plans to step down from the position she has held since January __int_4__ Nassar worked as a university sports physician from __int_4__ to __int_4__ Michigan State faculty members Tuesday called for an emergency meeting of the faculty senate for a vote of no confidence in Simon, according to Robert Laduca Jr. of the Michigan State academic governance steering committee. MSU steering committee will ask Academic Congress, which comprises faculty members, whether it supports having the faculty senate take a vote of no confidence in Simon, according to Laduca. Besides questions about Michigan State handling of complaints against the serial molester, the scandal has had repercussions for USA Gymnastics, which also employed him. That organization announced resignations from its board of directors' executive leadership. USA Gymnastics and Michigan State have separately said they reported Nassar abuse as soon as they learned about it. Circuit Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina is expected to announce Nassar sentence. He faces up to __int_3__ years in prison, and has already been sentenced to __int_2__ years in prison for federal child pornography charges.

      "On Wednesday, a number of mainstream news outlets appeared to report that the Washington Redskins football team were changing their controversial nickname to the Washington Redhawks. The stories quoted team owners, coaches and Native American activists and even showed the team new helmet and logos. There was just one problem the stories were completely fabricated. Shortly after the stories began circulating online, the Washington Redskins released a statement denying the rumors. Sports Illustrated, one of the outlets that \"reported\" the name change, also warned Twitter users against spreading the fake news stories. But that did stop a number of prominent journalists and activists from sharing the story. This change is a long time coming. GoRedHawks Dallas Goldtooth (December __int_2__ The Washington Redhawks hoax turned out to be one of the most believable fake news stories in recent memory. Not only was the prankster able make it appear as if the story was appearing on multiple webpages like ESPN, Sports Illustrated and the Washington Post, but the \"news sites\" all looked fairly believable, with legitimate logos, branding and layout designs. But the pranksters did leave behind clues to indicate the story was fake: The fake sites' URLs did quite match up with the real news sites' URLs (bleacherreport.news, espnsports.news) and all of the stories were credited to staff writer an extremely unusual concession for a news room to make on a story of that magnitude. Shortly after the hoax went viral, a group claiming to be the Rising Hearts Coalition, an indigenous and women organization based in Washington, took responsibility for the hoax.
